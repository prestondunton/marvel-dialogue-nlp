       "535   You think you’re the only one who’s lost people?  What do you think we’re doing here?  I lost the only family I ever had.  Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone.  I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads.  I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone.  Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone.  And you can help them.  So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back?   \n",
