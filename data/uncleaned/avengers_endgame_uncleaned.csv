CLINT BARTON,"Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there. Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow. "
CLINT BARTON,"Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers- "
LILA BARTON,Why three? 
CLINT BARTON,‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s too much- 
LAURA BARTON,"You guys want mustard or mayo, or both? CLINT TURNS.  IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer. "
LILA BARTON,Who puts mayo on a hot dog? 
CLINT BARTON,"We’ll both have mustard, hon! (to Lila) Okay.  Draw back, deep breath... She lets loose.  THUD!  HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. "
CLINT BARTON,"Good job, Hawkeye.  Go get your arrow. "
LAURA BARTON,Enough murder practice!  Soup’s on! 
CLINT BARTON,"One sec, babe.  Be right there! We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. We’re hungry. But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE.  The bow and arrow lie at his feet.  He stares. "
CLINT BARTON,"Lila?  Babe, did you see Lila- He turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE.  So are the boys.  The soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket. "
CLINT BARTON,"Guys?  Guys, come on... Clint walks toward the field, dread growing. "
CLINT BARTON,Laura? Clint breaks into a panicked run. 
CLINT BARTON,"LAURA! Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift... TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football.  She wins. "
TONY,"(offering his hand) Good sport.  Have fun? Nebula studies his hand, confused.  Finally she shakes. "
NEBULA,"It was fun. Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON MAN HELMET.  He hits a switch.  A light blinks. TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.” "
TONY,"This thing on?  Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep.  If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker. THE BENATAR sparks, adrift. "
TONY,"I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these.  I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty- two. NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound. "
TONY,"You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her.  She’s very practical.  And only a tiny bit sadistic. "
TONY,"The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge.  Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.  Problem is that was about...49 hours ago. "
TONY,"Which means, we’re dead in the water.  A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER.  She pushes it back to him. "
TONY,"Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago. Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the glass, staring into the unknown. "
TONY,"Pep, I know I said no more surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one.  But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. Back to now.  Tony records his thoughts into his helmet. "
TONY,"Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes.  Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately.  I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you.  It’s always you. Tony switches the helmet off. NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR. Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair.  Tony slumps, completely still.  Nebula gives him his privacy. Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER. Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun. Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes.  Tony’s eyelids flutter.  Finally, he opens them to see... CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. STEVE ROGERS shaves. He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted.  He’s about to tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when... THE WATER RIPPLES.  Steve stares a beat, puzzled.  Then the lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY. Just then, a sound roars overhead.  Steve turns... THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH.  Then the silhouette of THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS. Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch a flying woman guide the ship to the ground. Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group. Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp. "
TONY,I couldn’t stop him. 
STEVE,Neither could we. 
TONY,I lost the kid. 
STEVE,(unable to say it all) We...lost... 
TONY,Is Pepper...? 
PEPPER POTTS,"Stay here, you stay right here- "
TONY,"I’m not going anywhere. NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans.  ROCKET SITS BESIDE HER, GRATEFUL.  She rests a hand on his furry head. RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch... "
RHODEY,"It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth. TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into his arm.  He stares, taking in the loss: At Fury, Carol bites back emotion. "
NATASHA,"World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine.  But the parts that still work are trying to take a census.  It looks like he did what he said he was going to do. Finally, Tony looks away.  RHODEY turns it off. "
NATASHA,Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth. 
CAROL DANVERS,Not just Earth. 
RHODEY,You sure about that? 
CAROL DANVERS,You never have to ask me that. 
TONY,Where is he now? 
STEVE,We don’t know.  He just opened a portal and walked through. Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio. 
TONY,What’s his deal? 
ROCKET,He’s pissed. Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time. 
ROCKET,"He thinks he failed.  Which, of course, he did.  But there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there? "
TONY,"Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear. "
STEVE,"We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing.  Tony, you fought him- "
TONY,"Who told you that?  I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.  There was no fight because he’s not beatable. "
STEVE,"Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinates- Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve. "
TONY,"I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe.  I thought I was dreaming... "
STEVE,"Tony, I need you to focus- "
TONY,"And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need.  It’s too late, buddy.  You know what I need? Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable. "
TONY,"I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. (stands) And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- "
STEVE,"But that didn’t work out, did it? "
TONY,"I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.”  Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there.  But that’s what we do, right?  Our best work after the fact?  We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-” "
RHODEY,"Tony, take it easy... "
TONY,"I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap.  No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options.  Zero, zip, nada.  No trust. (rips out RT) Here.  You take this.  You find him, you put this on, and hide. (drops to his knees) I’m fine! Tony COLLAPSES.  Rhodey catches him. CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY "
RHODEY,Bruce gave him a sedative.  Should be out the rest of the day. 
CAROL DANVERS,"(heading for the lab) Take care of him.  When I come back, I’ll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir. "
STEVE,Where are you going? 
CAROL DANVERS,To kill Thanos. NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP. 
NATASHA,"Hey, hey, hang on.  We’re sort of a team here.  Between you and me, morale’s a little fragile. "
CAROL DANVERS,"Oh, I’m sorry.  My fault. Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up.  She claps her hands. "
CAROL DANVERS,"All right, team!  I’m going to go kill Thanos.  Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I’ll report back when he’s dead.  Great work, everybody. "
STEVE,"Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too. "
RHODEY,Do you even know where he is? 
CAROL DANVERS,I know people who might- 
NEBULA,Don’t bother. They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY. 
NEBULA,"I can tell you where Thanos is. STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL gather.  NEBULA studies her robotic hand. "
NEBULA,"Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me.  When he worked, he talked.  About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.  I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: “To the Garden.” "
RHODEY,You’re saying Thanos had a retirement plan. 
STEVE,Where’s this garden? ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP.  A BRIGHT SURGE OF 
ROCKET,"When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.  No one’s seen anything like it. He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN "
ROCKET,Until two days ago. 
NATASHA,You’re saying he snapped his fingers again.  Where? Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars... 
NEBULA,"Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soil- "
STEVE,A garden. 
BRUCE BANNER,Thanos is there.  And he just used the stones. Steve eyes everyone.  THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP. 
BRUCE BANNER,"(thinking of himself) You know, we’d be going short- handed. "
RHODEY,Because he killed all our friends. 
ROCKET,Are we saying they’re dead?  We’re using that word now? 
RHODEY,He’s still got the stones. 
CAROL DANVERS,"So, we take them.  And we use them to bring everybody back. "
BRUCE BANNER,Just like that? 
STEVE,Yeah.  Just like that. No one speaks.  Finally... 
NATASHA,"If there’s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who’s not sitting here to try. Everyone looks around the room...AGREED. "
BRUCE BANNER,If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before? 
CAROL DANVERS,Because before you didn’t have me. 
RHODEY,"Hey, new girl.  All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where’ve you been all this time? "
CAROL DANVERS,There’s a lot of people in the universe.  And they didn’t all have you. THOR STANDS.  He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand. Carol doesn’t flinch.  Thor smiles. 
THOR,"I like this one. Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment.  Then... "
STEVE,Let’s go get that son of a bitch. EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight deck.  STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
CAROL DANVERS,Trust me.  You get used to it. ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair. 
ROCKET,"Okay, who here hasn’t been to space? STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands. "
ROCKET,"Oh, you’re gonna hate this. "
NEBULA,"Approaching jump in three, two... STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as... As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet. "
CAROL DANVERS,"I’ll head down for recon.  If I’m not back in fifteen, you’ll know I found him. OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense. NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY "
NATASHA,"This is going to work, Steve. "
STEVE,I know it will. (beat) Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t. 
CAROL DANVERS,"No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It’s just him. "
NEBULA,"That’s enough. The Avengers exchange a look. A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE.  Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened.  A shell of his former self. He stirs the pot.  Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE.  CAROL AND THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others.  HE The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet.  He picks it up...and his face goes slack.  He turns the glove toward the others. And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE. "
STEVE,Where are they? Thanos doesn’t answer.  CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES. 
CAROL DANVERS,Answer the question! 
THANOS,"The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation. "
BRUCE BANNER,You murdered trillions. 
THANOS,You should be grateful. 
NATASHA,Where are the stones? 
THANOS,Gone.  Reduced to atoms. 
BRUCE BANNER,You used them two days ago! 
THANOS,"I used the stones to destroy the stones.  It nearly killed me. But the work is done.  It always will be. That lands, sickening.  ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS. "
ROCKET,No...they can’t be gone... 
RHODEY,He’s lying. 
NEBULA,My father is many things.  A liar is not one of them. 
THANOS,"Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve treated you- "
ROCKET,"What did you do? Thor just stares, his long journey a failure. "
THOR,"I went for the head. As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the ground.  IT’S OVER.  THEY LOST. A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi.  THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER. A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled parking lot.  Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER. The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.” A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP. "
GRIEVING MAN,"So, I went on a date the other day. "
JIMMY,"Good job, Bobby.  Back in the game. "
GRIEVING MAN,"Thank you, Jimmy. (to the group) First in five years.  I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about? STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY. "
STEVE,What did you talk about? 
GRIEVING MAN,"Same old crap.  How much things have changed.  How much we miss the Mets.  My job, his job.  Then it got kind of quiet.  He cried during the salads. "
OLDER MAN,What about you? 
GRIEVING MAN,I cried just before dessert.  But I’m seeing him again tomorrow. So... 
STEVE,"That’s great.  You’ve already done the hardest part.  You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take.  To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... (to everyone) I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life.  Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going. The group takes this in. "
STEVE,"The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us. People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words. THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE. LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL. STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN.  FLASH. THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG, ANT-MAN suit shorting.  He retracts his helmet, gasping. A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard.  He looks up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.” A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump.  Scott, in his old clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away. The Guard watches him go, puzzled. Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES. "
SCOTT LANG,"Hello? He hears A CLACKING.  A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing card wedged between his spokes. Scott waves him down.  The kid stops. "
SCOTT LANG,"Hey.  Kid.  What happened here? The kid says nothing.  He just stares at Scott with a haunted look.  Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park.  A small crowd mills.  Reveal Scott looking over the monuments, lost. Scott walks up to the obelisks.  At the top, they read: “THE VANISHED.”  Hundreds of names line the stones. He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.” "
SCOTT LANG,"What? (realizing) Cassie... A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house. He leaps a bush, banging on the front door. "
SCOTT LANG,"Cassie!  Cassie! SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked.  A very long beat. "
CASSIE LANG,Dad? 
SCOTT LANG,"Peanut? Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years older than when he last saw her.  She hugs him, CRYING. "
CASSIE LANG,I thought you were gone. 
SCOTT LANG,I’m sorry.  I’m back...I’m back...I’m back... Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass.  Rusty chains lock the gate. Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA.  KEEP OUT.” 
ROCKET,We boarded that “highly suspect warship” Danvers pinged. 
NATASHA,And? 
NEBULA,It was an infectious garbage scow. 
ROCKET,So thanks for the hot tip- 
CAROL DANVERS,You were closer. 
ROCKET,And now we smell like garbage- 
NATASHA,(to Okoye) You get a reading on those tremors? 
OKOYE,Minor subduction in the African plate. 
NATASHA,Do we have a visual?  How are you handling it? 
OKOYE,Nat.  It was a mild earthquake.  In the ocean.  We handle it by not handling it. Natasha looks burdened.  Rhodey steps in. 
RHODEY,"I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure. "
NATASHA,"Thanks.  Carol, you’re still coming our way next month? "
CAROL DANVERS,Not likely. 
ROCKET,Getting another haircut? 
CAROL DANVERS,"Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory out here.  The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else.  On thousands of planets.  You might not see me for a long time. "
NATASHA,"All right.  Everybody keep keeping their eyes open.  This channel’s always active.  Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn’t, it comes through me. They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey. "
NATASHA,What’s up?  Where are you? 
RHODEY,Mexico.  Got some news. 
NATASHA,Okay... 
RHODEY,Federalés found a room full of bodies outside Juarez.  Cartel guys.  Guns still in their pants. 
NATASHA,Could be a rival hit- 
RHODEY,But it wasn’t.  Same MO as Marseille.  And Kiev. 
RHODEY,"(beat) It’s definitely Barton. She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting. "
RHODEY,"What he’s done here...what he’s been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn’t want to find him. Natasha just stares a long beat. "
NATASHA,"Find out where’s he going next. Rhodey nods, signing off.  Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES. After a long beat... "
STEVE,I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already. Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway. 
NATASHA,Come by to do your laundry? 
STEVE,And see a friend. 
NATASHA,Your friend’s fine. 
STEVE,She leave the house today? 
NATASHA,Nothing out there I particularly want to see. 
STEVE,I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge. 
NATASHA,(dubious) In the Hudson. 
STEVE,"Fewer ships, cleaner water.  Just saying, there’s still a world out there. "
RHODEY,
NATASHA,"If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I’m about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich. Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. "
STEVE,Sorry.  Force of habit. 
NATASHA,I don’t know how you do it. Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich. 
STEVE,I guess I don’t know how not to. 
NATASHA,"Me, neither. After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. "
STEVE,"I keep telling them, move on.  Grow past it.  And some of them actually do.  But not us. "
NATASHA,"If I move on, who does this? "
STEVE,Maybe it doesn’t need to be done. Natasha takes that in.  Steve is thinking of giving up.  She looks around at Avengers Compound. 
NATASHA,"I used to have nothing.  Then I got this.  This job, this family.  And I was better because of it. She chokes slightly, collecting herself. "
NATASHA,"And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be...better. "
STEVE,I think we both need to get a life. 
NATASHA,"You first. They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment. "
SCOTT LANG,"Hello?  Is anyone home?  This is, uh, Scott Lang?  We met a few years ago.  At the airport? "
STEVE,This an old message? 
NATASHA,"(stunned) It’s the front gate. SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. "
STEVE,"Scott, are you okay? "
SCOTT LANG,What?  Yes. He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. 
SCOTT LANG,Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 
NATASHA,Only to make conversation. Steve glances at her.  She shrugs. 
SCOTT LANG,"Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe.  You can only get there if you’re incredibly small.  Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out.  But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there. "
NATASHA,I’m sorry.  It must’ve been a long five years. 
SCOTT LANG,"(getting excited) Okay, but that’s the thing.  It wasn’t.  For me, it was only five hours.  The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich? "
STEVE,"Scott, what are you talking about? "
SCOTT LANG,Time works differently in the Quantum Realm. Steve and Natasha share a look. 
SCOTT LANG,"Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it.  But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another.  Like, before Thanos- "
STEVE,Wait...wait.  Scott.  Are you talking about a time machine? 
SCOTT LANG,"No, not a machine.  More like a... (searches, then gives up) Yeah, like a time machine.  I know it sounds crazy... "
NATASHA,"Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing’s crazy anymore. "
SCOTT LANG,"So, who do we talk to about this? LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND. TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house. "
TONY,"Morgan H. Stark.  Chow time.  Want some lunch? Silence.  Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE). "
MORGAN STARK,Define lunch or be disintegrated. 
TONY,"You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom.  You thinking about lunch? Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL. "
TONY,Where’d you find this? 
MORGAN STARK,"Garage. Tony picks her up, walking toward the house. "
TONY,"You like going in the garage?  So does Daddy.  It’s all right.  Mommy never wears what I buy her. Tony and Morgan exit the woods.  Suddenly, Tony stops. In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him.  NATASHA AND STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY. "
TONY,I just want to thank you folks for dropping by.  It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape. 
NATASHA,You’ve got some objections to the plan. 
TONY,"So you’re calling it a plan.  To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method.  Not to mention, it’s impossible. "
SCOTT LANG,We know what it sounds like. 
STEVE,"Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible? "
TONY,"Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? (offering more tea) Chai? (back on message) In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home. "
SCOTT LANG,I did. 
TONY,Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.  Now you want to pull a- What are you calling it? 
SCOTT LANG,A time heist. 
TONY,"Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again? "
SCOTT LANG,Still Scott... 
STEVE,"Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here. "
NATASHA,We can snap our own fingers.  We can bring everybody back. 
TONY,Or screw it up worse than he already has. 
STEVE,"I don’t believe we would. Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge. "
TONY,"Gotta say it.  Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism.  Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.”  I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. "
SCOTT LANG,Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.  No talking to our past selves.  No betting on sporting events- 
TONY,"Stop, Scott.  Stop.  Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future? "
SCOTT LANG,(meaning “yes”) No... 
TONY,"Good.  Because that would be horseshit.  Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works. "
NATASHA,We have to take a stand. 
TONY,We did stand.  And yet here we are. 
SCOTT LANG,"Look, Stark-  Can I call you Tony? "
TONY,Please don’t- 
SCOTT LANG,Tony- 
TONY,Fine. 
SCOTT LANG,"I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here.  You’ve got a wife.  A daughter.  But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t even- "
TONY,"No, Scott.  I won’t.  Even. Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch. "
MORGAN STARK,Mommy told me to come save you. Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. 
TONY,Good job.  I’m saved. (to Steve) I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.  I’m honestly happy to see you.  If you want to stay- Steve tries one last time. 
STEVE,"Tony, I get it.  And I’m happy for you.  I am.  But this is a second chance. "
TONY,"Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here.  I can’t roll the dice on it.  The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch. He exits. Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car. "
NATASHA,He’s scared. 
STEVE,He’s not wrong. 
SCOTT LANG,What are we gonna do?  We need him. You want to stop? 
STEVE,No.  I want to do it right. (beat) We’re going to need a really big brain. 
SCOTT LANG,"Bigger than his? ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside. "
SCOTT LANG,I’m confused. 
SMART HULK,These are confusing times. 
SCOTT LANG,"No, that’s not what I’m- "
SMART HULK,"I’m kidding, I get it.  It’s crazy. I wear shirts now! "
SCOTT LANG,But why? 
SMART HULK,"Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right? --- Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites. "
STEVE,He’s heard. 
SMART HULK,It was worse for me.  Because I lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then Banner lost.  Then we all lost. 
NATASHA,"No one blamed you, Bruce. "
SMART HULK,"I did-  I feel like I’m the only one eating.  Here, try some. He holds out a pizza.  They decline.  He shrugs. "
SMART HULK,"Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way.  That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos. "
SCOTT LANG,Okay.  But how did...this happen? 
SMART HULK,"For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together. "
SMART HULK,Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together.  And now look at me. Best of both worlds. TWO KIDS amble up to the booth. 
KID,Mr. Hulk?  Can we get a picture? 
SMART HULK,"100%, little lady. The kid hands a phone to Steve.  SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back. "
SMART HULK,"(to the fan) Thanks, pal.  Hulk out! "
STEVE,"So, Bruce, about what we said- "
SMART HULK,"The time travel do-over?  I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise... Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them. "
NATASHA,"You pulled this off.  I remember a time that was impossible, too. He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone. "
SMART HULK,"I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around. TONY STARK DOES DISHES.  He rinses with the sprayer.  It goes everywhere.  He wipes down the counter, including... A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER.  He stares. Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes.  He studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued. "
TONY,"Friday, you up? "
FRIDAY,"Yes, sir. "
TONY,"I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out.  I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night.  This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted. "
FRIDAY,Processing. The model forms. 
TONY,"All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp.  Run it.  That’ll take a second.  And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of... "
FRIDAY,Model rendered. 
TONY,(in awe) Shit. 
MORGAN STARK,Shit. Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway. 
TONY,What are you doing up? 
MORGAN STARK,Shit. 
TONY,"First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it. "
MORGAN STARK,Why are you up? 
TONY,I just had something on my mind. 
MORGAN STARK,Was it juice pops? 
TONY,Correct.  Great minds think alike. What kind do you want? Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed.  Tony watches. 
TONY,You done? (finishing her popsicle) Now you are. 
MORGAN STARK,Tell me a story. 
TONY,"Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.  The end. "
MORGAN STARK,That was a bad story. He runs his hand over her hair. 
TONY,Love you tons. 
MORGAN STARK,Love you three thousand. 
TONY,"Wow, that’s a lot. Tony turns out the light, exits. PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony.  Even one of Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading.  Then... "
TONY,Out like a light.  Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand. 
PEPPER POTTS,That’s up there. 
TONY,What’re you reading? 
PEPPER POTTS,A book about composting- 
TONY,I think I solved it. Pepper looks up. 
PEPPER POTTS,Just so we’re both talking about the same thing- 
TONY,Time travel. 
PEPPER POTTS,That’s amazing. 
TONY,Yeah. 
PEPPER POTTS,And terrifying. 
TONY,"To say the least. He sits beside her.  She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA. "
PEPPER POTTS,We got really lucky- 
TONY,I know- 
PEPPER POTTS,Not everybody did. 
TONY,I can’t help everybody. 
PEPPER POTTS,"Except, it sort of seems like you can. "
TONY,Not if I stopped right here. 
PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. "
TONY,"I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed. "
PEPPER POTTS,But could you rest? 
SCOTT LANG,"You’re sure these modifications are safe? He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, "
SMART HULK,I reran my calculations three times- 
SCOTT LANG,Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius- 
SMART HULK,"I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy.  We’re good. "
SCOTT LANG,Yeah.  And you look like that on purpose. STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside. 
STEVE,"Breakers are set, emergency generator’s on stand-by. "
SMART HULK,"Good.  If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s. "
SCOTT LANG,Excuse me? 
NATASHA,He was kidding. 
SMART HULK,I was kidding. 
NATASHA,"(to Hulk) You were kidding, right? "
SMART HULK,"Honestly, I have no idea.  We’re attempting time travel.  Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. (loudly to Scott) We’re good!  Helmet on. Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious. "
SMART HULK,"Okay.  I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds.  Make sense? "
SCOTT LANG,Perfectly not confusing. 
STEVE,"Good luck, Scott.  You’ve got this. "
SCOTT LANG,"(inspired) Yes, I do, Captain America.  Yes, I- "
SMART HULK,"Counting down from three, two, one... "
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, guys?  This doesn’t feel right. "
NATASHA,Is that Scott? 
SMART HULK,"Probably...? He scrambles, hitting buttons.  SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. "
STEVE,Get him back! Smart Hulk flips a switch.  SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93. 
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, my back! "
NATASHA,Bruce!  Get it under control.  What the hell is going on? 
SMART HULK,"I got it, I know exactly what’s going on.  Pretty much. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN.  HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys. "
NATASHA,"Oh, my God. "
STEVE,It’s a baby. 
SMART HULK,It’s Scott. 
STEVE,As a baby! Smart Hulk hits a button.  Baby Scott disappears. 
SMART HULK,"When I tell you, kill the power! (throwing a switch) Now! NATASHA KILLS THE POWER.  Normal Scott stumbles off the pad. "
SCOTT LANG,"Somebody peed my pants.  I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me. Steve leans on the wall, discouraged.  Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR.  AN AUDI races up the drive. It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY. "
TONY,"Why the long face?  Wild guess, he turned into a baby? "
STEVE,Among other things. 
TONY,"(getting out of the car) EPR Paradox.  Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang.  It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it. "
STEVE,You did. 
TONY,"Thank god, I’m here.  Regardless, I fixed it. He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR. "
TONY,"That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS.  I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive.  I hate it. "
STEVE,"Me, too. Something eases between them, for the first time in years. "
TONY,"We’ve got a shot at the Stones.  I just need you to know my priorities.  Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully.  Keep what I found, definitely.  And, let’s not die trying. Steve looks at Tony.  Finally, he offers his hand. "
STEVE,Sounds like a deal. They shake.  This is a long time coming.  Finally... 
TONY,"But wait, there’s more.   Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer. Tony pops the trunk.  Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD. "
STEVE,"Tony, I don’t know- "
TONY,"What’s to know?  He made it for you.  Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM. "
STEVE,"Thank you, Tony. Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk. "
TONY,"Just don’t flaunt it.  I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right? "
STEVE,"We’re trying. SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco.  THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away. THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND.  NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE.  Rocket waits at the end of the gangway. "
ROCKET,"Hey, Humie.  Where’s Big Green? "
SCOTT LANG,"Um, kitchen, I think. Scott tries a smile at Nebula.  She just hits her COM: "
NEBULA,"Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone. She goes in.  THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. "
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, my God! "
RHODEY,"What’s up, Regular-Sized Man? Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag.  He hands Scott some tacos. "
ROCKET,Finally.  I ain’t got all day. 
SMART HULK,"I call shotgun! As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE. Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND "
ROCKET,What the heck are they looking at? 
SMART HULK,I’m kind of famous... 
ROCKET,"Yeah, I’m sure that’s it.  Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers... "
SMART HULK,"They lost Asgard, then half their people.  Maybe they’re just happy to have a home. "
VALKYRIE,You shouldn’t have come. VALKYRIE approaches from the pier.  Smart Hulk GRINS. 
SMART HULK,"Hey, Valkyrie!  Great to see you! He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T.  She studies the new him. "
VALKYRIE,Uh huh.  I liked you better either of the other ways. 
SMART HULK,This is Rocket. 
ROCKET,Hey. 
VALKYRIE,Hey. (to both) He won’t see you. 
SMART HULK,We didn’t say we were here to see- 
VALKYRIE,"Great, then you can hose out the gut buckets- "
ROCKET,We’re definitely here to see him. 
VALKYRIE,He can’t give you what you need. 
SMART HULK,It’s that bad? 
VALKYRIE,We only see him once a month.  When he comes in for “supplies.” She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB. Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN.  Nothing. SMART HULK opens the door.  PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor.  Rocket recoils. 
ROCKET,Something died in here. 
SMART HULK,Hello...?  Thor...? 
THOR,Are you here about the cable? We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches. 
THOR,"Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy... THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT.  Rocket and Hulk stare. "
SMART HULK,Thor? 
THOR,"BROS!  Bring it in! Thor hugs Smart Hulk.  He turns to Rocket, who steps back. "
ROCKET,"Yeah, I’m good. "
THOR,"Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right? KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4. "
KORG,Beer’s in the bucket.  Feel free to log on to the WiFi. 
SMART HULK,"Hey, guys.  Long time no- "
KORG,Thor!  This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead! 
THOR,Noobmaster again? 
KORG,NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead- Thor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic. 
THOR,"Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder.  This is your last warning.  Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt. (handing the headset back) Right, who wants a drink? SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE.  Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER. "
SMART HULK,"Hey, buddy, are you all right? "
THOR,Don’t I look all right? 
ROCKET,(under his breath) You look like melted ice cream- 
THOR,"So, what’s up?  Just here for a hang? "
SMART HULK,We need your help.  There’s a chance we can fix everything. 
THOR,Like the cable?  It’s driving me bananas. 
SMART HULK,Like Thanos. 
THOR,Don’t say that name. 
KORG,"Yeah, we don’t say that name in here. Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT. "
SMART HULK,Please take your hand off me. Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand. 
SMART HULK,"Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare you- "
THOR,"Scared?  Why would I be scared of that guy?  I’m the one who killed that guy, remember? (looking around) Anyone else here kill that guy? "
THOR,"Didn’t think so.  Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos’ head off. "
KORG,"Stormbreaker? Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle.  BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND. Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING. "
THOR,Not.  Cool.  Man. 
ROCKET,Don’t.  Care.  Dude. 
SMART HULK,"Look, I get it.  You’re in a rough patch.  I’ve been there.  But you know who helped me out of it? "
THOR,Was it Natasha? 
SMART HULK,It was you.  You helped me.  And I need you to help me again. 
THOR,Ask the Asgardians down there how much “my help” is worth. 
ROCKET,At least they’re alive- 
THOR,"They were gods!  Now they’re fisherpeople! (sagging into a chair) The ones that are left, anyway. "
SMART HULK,"That’s the thing.  I think we can bring them back. Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head. "
THOR,"Stop.  Stop.  I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own self- pity, waiting to be rescued.  But I’m fine.  I’m happy.  Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less. "
THOR,Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor. 
SMART HULK,"Come on, pal.  We need you. He still can’t meet their gaze.  Finally... "
ROCKET,There’s beer in the ship. 
THOR,(beat) What kind? 
AKIHIKO,"(Japanese, subtitled) Why are you doing this?  We never did anything to you! "
RONIN,"(Japanese, subtitled) You survived.  Half the planet didn’t.  They got Thanos.  You get me. Akihiko attacks.  Ronin slashes him across the middle. "
RONIN,"(Japanese, subtitled) You’re done hurting people. Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street. "
AKIHIKO,We hurt people?  You’re crazy. Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat.  The man drops to his knees. 
AKIHIKO,Wait!  Help me!  I’ll give you anything!  What do you want? 
RONIN,"What I want...you can’t give me. Ronin finishes him off.  AKIHIKO GOES STILL.  SIRENS WAIL. Ronin removes his mask, revealing... CLINT BARTON, haggard.  He hears A FOOTFALL.  He whirls, katana raised...then stops.  His face goes slack as... They stare at each other.  Clint hasn’t seen her in years. She hasn’t seen what he’s become. -- "
CLINT BARTON,You shouldn’t be here. 
NATASHA,Neither should you. 
CLINT BARTON,I’ve got a job to do. 
NATASHA,That what you’re calling this? She moves even closer.  He stiffens. 
NATASHA,"Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back. (beat) We found something.  A chance, maybe... "
CLINT BARTON,Don’t. 
NATASHA,Don’t what? 
CLINT BARTON,Give me hope. 
NATASHA,"I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it sooner. CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms. THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM "
TONY,"Out of the way, Lebowski. Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past. "
TONY,"Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there? "
ROCKET,"It’s Rocket, and shut up.  You’re only a genius on Earth, pal. "
TONY,And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands. 
ROCKET,Fixed it. 
TONY,Thank you. 
ROCKET,"Get used to saying that. SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT.  NEBULA ASSISTS.  RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit. "
RHODEY,"Time travel suit, I like it. SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES "
SCOTT LANG,"Easy, easy.  Careful with those. "
SMART HULK,I’m being very careful- 
SCOTT LANG,"You’re being very Hulky- Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself. "
SCOTT LANG,"These are Pym Particles.  You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more.  I told you.  We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs. Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing. "
SCOTT LANG,"Plus two test runs- SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK.  He takes that in... "
SCOTT LANG,"One test run. (embarrassed) Okay, maybe I’m not ready. "
CLINT BARTON,I’m game. They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway. 
CLINT BARTON,"I’ll do it. NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT.  Scott looks on, sulky. SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing. "
SMART HULK,"Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshift- "
RHODEY,"Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know... Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE. "
SMART HULK,"Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos.  Time doesn’t work like that.  You can’t change the future by changing the past. "
SCOTT LANG,"Sure, we can.  We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them.  Problem solved. "
NEBULA,That’s not how it works. 
CLINT BARTON,I don’t know.  That is kind of what I’ve heard- 
SMART HULK,Heard from who? 
RHODEY,Star Trek.  Terminator.  Bill and Ted’s Excellent- 
SMART HULK,"WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE.  IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE! "
NEBULA,Exactly. 
RHODEY,"Excuse me? Scott leans over, whispering: "
SCOTT LANG,"Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit. "
CLINT BARTON,"Look, are we doing this or not? SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on. "
SMART HULK,"Okay, Clint.  Starting in three, two, one... Clint nods over at them, determined.  SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor.  ENERGY He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME. Clint climbs the porch.  He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL MITT.  Then he hears VOICES. He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR.  From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS.  Clint’s face crumples.  Just then...HIS "
CLINT BARTON,"No.  Not yet... (opening the door) LILA! SCREEN DOOR SLAMS.  After a moment, LILA runs in. "
LILA BARTON,"Dad? CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN.  TONY and NATASHA approach. "
NATASHA,"Are you all right?  Hey, look at me.  You okay? "
TONY,"Tell me something good... Clint looks up, tearful.  He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT. "
CLINT BARTON,"It worked.  It worked. Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on. "
ROCKET,"Holy crap.  We’re freaking time travelers. On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.” Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: "
STEVE,"Okay.  Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when. NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on. "
STEVE,Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones- 
TONY,I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones. 
SCOTT LANG,I haven’t. (off their looks) Just...saying. 
SMART HULK,"Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each.  And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. "
TONY,Our history.  Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. 
CLINT BARTON,Which means we’ve got to pick our targets. 
STEVE,"Exactly. (he taps “REALITY”) Let’s start with the Aether.  Thor, what do we know? Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over. "
NATASHA,Is he asleep? 
RHODEY,"I’m pretty sure he’s dead. THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY” Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.” "
THOR,"The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge.  My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years. HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction.  Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye. "
THOR,"Or...by Jane.  She stuck her hand in a rock.  Then the Aether stuck itself inside her.  Then I took her to Asgard.  We were dating... (depressed) We’re not anymore. Everyone stares. CLOSE ON a holo image of THE ORB: “POWER.”  Locations are listed: “MORAG ?-2014, KYLN 2014, XANDAR 2014-2018.” "
ROCKET,"Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT "
SMART HULK,That’s a person? 
ROCKET,It’s a planet.  Quill was a person. 
SCOTT LANG,"Wait, like a planet...in space? Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek. "
ROCKET,"Aw, look.  It’s like a puppy, all happy and everything. "
ROCKET,"You want to go to space, puppy? I’ll take you to space. Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit quietly, listening to Nebula. "
NEBULA,Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. 
NATASHA,And that is...? 
NEBULA,A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence. (beat) It’s the place where Thanos murdered my sister. That hangs heavily.  A moment passes.  Then... 
SCOTT LANG,"Not it. Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out. "
NATASHA,So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what kind of doctor was he? 
SMART HULK,Strange? 
TONY,Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat. 
SMART HULK,Had a nice place in the Village. 
TONY,Yeah.  Sullivan Street. 
ROCKET,
SMART HULK,Bleecker. 
TONY,Sullivan and Bleecker.  They’re cross streets. 
NATASHA,"Wait, he lived in New York?  Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York. "
SMART HULK,(beat) Shut the front door... STEVE blocks our view. 
STEVE,"Okay, we have a plan.  Six stones, three teams, one shot. He steps away, revealing the board... "
STEVE,"Five years ago, we lost.  All of us. "
STEVE,"We lost friends.  We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. (beat) But today we have a chance to take it all back. Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT "
STEVE,"You have your teams and you have assignments.  Get your stone, and get back here.  One round trip each.  No mistakes.  No do-overs. He grips HIS SHIELD. "
STEVE,"Most of us are going back to places we know.  That doesn’t mean we know what to expect.  Be careful.  Look out for each other.  Improvise, if you have to. (looking around) This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. (beat) Whatever it takes. The platform stays quiet.  Rocket WHISPERS to Scott: "
ROCKET,He’s pretty good at that... Scott nods enthusiastically. 
TONY,"(to Smart Hulk) All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL.  LIGHTS "
SMART HULK,Tracking beacons engaged. Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside. 
ROCKET,You promise to bring that thing back in one piece? 
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, sure thing.  I’ll do my best. "
ROCKET,"That’s pretty lame, as far as promises go. "
NATASHA,See you in a minute. 
SMART HULK,"Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or- At the same time, just a block away... FLASH!  STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the mouth of an alley, just out of sight. "
TONY,"Okay, Park Avenue’s that way. Let’s huddle up.  Suits off. They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS. "
STEVE,"We’ve all got our assignments.  Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time- Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS. "
STEVE,And Bruce?  Maybe smash a few things along the way.  For appearances. 
SMART HULK,"(taking off his shirt) All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous. He half-heartedly smashes a few cars. "
SMART HULK,"Grrr...grrr... ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS.  He heads for a door, but... "
ANCIENT ONE,I’d be careful going that way... He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM. 
ANCIENT ONE,We just had the floors waxed. 
SMART HULK,Hulk...does what...Hulk want? 
ANCIENT ONE,"Yes, I suppose that would be the case- Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish.  The Ancient One looks at him. "
ANCIENT ONE,Care to explain? 
SMART HULK,I’m looking for Dr. Strange. 
ANCIENT ONE,"You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way.  What do you want with him? He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK. "
SMART HULK,"Well, that, actually. "
ANCIENT ONE,Ah.  I’m afraid not. 
SMART HULK,I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking. Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in.  She smiles. 
ANCIENT ONE,You don’t want to do this. 
SMART HULK,"You’re right, I don’t.  But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate it- He reaches for it.  THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS “ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body.  He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed. "
ASTRAL BANNER,"No, no, no- She topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger.  Whump. "
ANCIENT ONE,"Now.  Let’s start over, shall we? AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A "
MAIDEN,"For you, Lady Jane. "
JANE FOSTER,"Um, do you have anything with...pants? "
MAIDEN,Pants? 
JANE FOSTER,"It’s okay.  Nevermind. Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt. Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE. "
THOR,That’s Jane. 
ROCKET,"Okay, here’s the deal.  You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split. Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious. "
THOR,"Um, I’ll be right back.  The wine cellar is just down here.  My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale.  Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups- They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING.  Rocket yanks Thor back as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR. "
FRIGGA,"Send Loki some soup.  I don’t think he’s eating.  And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves.  He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company. Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall. "
ROCKET,Who’s the fancy broad? 
THOR,My mother.  She dies today. 
ROCKET,"Oh, jeez. Thor starts to sweat. "
THOR,I can’t do this.  This is a bad idea.  I can’t do this... Rocket climbs onto a marble monument. 
ROCKET,Come here. Thor steps closer.  ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. 
ROCKET,"You think you’re the only one who’s lost people?  What do you think we’re doing here?  I lost the only family I ever had.  Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone.  I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads.  I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone.  Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone.  And you can help them.  So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back? Thor stares at him a long moment.  He wipes his tears away. "
THOR,I guess not. 
ROCKET,Good. 
THOR,Thank you.  I can do this. 
ROCKET,"Great. As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself. "
THOR,I can do this...I can do this... (beat) I can’t do this... 
ROCKET,"(peering through keyhole) All right, heartbreaker.  This is our shot... Rocket turns to find...THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. "
ROCKET,Thor? (holding his temples) 
ROCKET,"I can kill him, and say the Elves did it. "
RHODEY,"That’s it, right on that line, Blue.  Keep dropping it. Nearby, CLINT SURVEYS THE PLANET.  GEYSERS EXPLODE.  CLIFFS LOOM.  AN ORLONI bites NATASHA’s boot.  She kicks it away. "
CLINT BARTON,"(to Rhodey) Hey, can we hurry it up? "
NATASHA,"Yeah, come on, chop chop, we’re on the clock, here. "
RHODEY,All that?  Really helpful! Clint and Natasha board the Benatar.  Rhodey and Nebula remain on the planet’s surface. 
NATASHA,Take care of yourself. 
RHODEY,Get that stone and come back.  No messing around.  You guys watch each other’s six. 
NEBULA,Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out. 
ROCKET,"Clint laughs, watching Natasha expertly pilot a spaceship. "
NATASHA,What? 
CLINT BARTON,Nothing.  Just...we’re a long way from Budapest. 
NATASHA,(pushing the throttle) Further every second. 
RHODEY,"So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? "
NEBULA,Let’s take cover.  We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones. 
RHODEY,"Hey, who are you talking about right now?  Who else is looking for the stones? "
NEBULA,My father.  My sister.  And me. 
RHODEY,"You?  Where are you? She leads Thanos’ troops onward as they lay waste to the Korbinite home world.  JUST THEN... Suddenly, A GREEN BLUR LEAPS IN, SLICING THE RIFLEMEN’S REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister.  Beat. "
GAMORA,You’re welcome? 
BAD NEBULA,I didn’t ask for your help. 
GAMORA,And yet you always need it.  Father wants us back on the ship. Gamora offers her hand.  Bad Nebula stands on her own. 
BAD NEBULA,Why? 
GAMORA,He’s found an Infinity Stone. Off Bad Nebula’s intrigued look... BAD NEBULA and GAMORA study a holo-map. 
BAD NEBULA,Where? 
GAMORA,On a planet called “Morag.” 
BAD NEBULA,Father’s plan is finally in motion. 
GAMORA,One stone isn’t six. 
BAD NEBULA,"It’s a start.  If he gets them all... THANOS steps from the smoke, armored, wielding A HUGE BLADE. "
GAMORA,"We’ll never have to do this again. THREE ALIENS CHARGE HIM.  THANOS CUTS THEM DOWN.  He wipes blood from his face, and SMILES. "
BAD NEBULA,He’ll miss it. He looks up to his ship.  A BEAM BATHES HIM IN LIGHT... Bad Nebula and Gamora turn as THANOS ENTERS THE FLIGHT DECK. 
THANOS,Ronan has located the Power Stone. I’m dispatching you to his ship. 
GAMORA,He won’t like it. Thanos wipes the blood from his blade. 
THANOS,"His alternative is death.  Ronan’s obsession clouds his judgement. After Loki, I’m taking no chances. "
BAD NEBULA,"We will not fail you, father. Thanos finally lays his eyes on her. "
THANOS,No.  You won’t. 
BAD NEBULA,"I swear I will make you proud- SUDDENLY, BAD NEBULA STAGGERS, hand to the wall. "
GAMORA,"Sister, what’s- Thanos watches, curious, as NEBULA DROPS TO A KNEE. "
RHODEY,"So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? "
NEBULA,"Let’s take cover.  We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones. BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection.  Gamora goes to her, trying to prop her up. "
GAMORA,Who was that? 
BAD NEBULA,I...don’t know.  My head...splitting... Bad Nebula winces.  Gamora looks to Thanos. 
GAMORA,Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle- 
THANOS,Sshhh... Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula.  He gently lifts her head with his blade.  Something’s not right. 
THANOS,"Bring her to my ship. Tony swoops onto the helipad outside the wrecked penthouse. THE MIND STONE GLOWS IN LOKI’S SCEPTER.  Pull back to see it’s in A1 NATASHA’S HANDS, as she stands with... SHOT FROM AVENGERS 1), all staring down at...LOKI. "
LOKI,"If it’s all the same to you...I’ll have that drink now. From behind cover, TONY PEERS AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE "
TONY,"Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass. "
STEVE,"No one asked you to look, Tony. "
SCOTT LANG,"I think you look great, Cap.  As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass. "
A1 NATASHA,Who gets the magic wand? 
A1 STEVE,SHIELD’s coming up now. 
TONY,"Ball’s in play.  Head’s up, Cap. From hiding, Tony eyes A1 NATASHA WITH LOKI’S SCEPTER. STEVE negotiates an empty hallway, head on a swivel.  He heads for AN ELEVATOR. "
TONY,Mind Stone’s on the move. 
STEVE,I’m in position. A1 NATASHA hands LOKI’S SCEPTER to...AGENT SITWELL.  He’s about to touch the tip when... 
A1 NATASHA,Careful with that. A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony’s bar. 
A1 CLINT BARTON,Unless you want your mind erased. And not in the fun way. Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS.  BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.” 
BROCK RUMLOW,We promise to be extra careful. Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. 
SCOTT LANG,Who are these guys? 
TONY,"SHIELD.  Actually, Hydra.  But we didn’t know that yet. "
SCOTT LANG,Seriously?  ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys. 
TONY,You’re small but you’re talking loud. 
A1 STEVE,I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue. Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE. 
LOKI/STEVE,"“I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.”  I mean, really, how do you keep your food down? Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM. "
A1 THOR,"Yes, that’s much better. He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR. "
A1 THOR,"You coming, Stark? Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE. "
A1 TONY,"One sec, just packing my lunch. "
TONY,"All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone A1 Tony crosses to the elevator.  Scott takes position, readying himself. "
SCOTT LANG,"All right.  Flick me. Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around him as he falls. A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator.  Then... A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR.  Avengers smile awkwardly.  There’s no room. "
A1 HULK,(angrily) Hulk take stairs. Tony circles around the building...PASSING THE DESCENDING 
TONY,"Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just passing the 80th floor. "
STEVE,Got it.  Head to the lobby. 
TONY,"Already on my way. Sitwell, Rumlow, and the STRIKE TEAM descend. "
AGENT SITWELL,"Evidence secured, we are en route to Dr. List...No, no hitches at all, Mr. Secretary... The car stops.  The doors open...AND OUR STEVE GETS ON. "
AGENT SITWELL,"Captain, I thought you were coordinating search and rescue? "
STEVE,"Change of plans. Steve glances at Rumlow, who’s holding THE SCEPTER. "
BROCK RUMLOW,Cap. 
STEVE,Rumlow. The doors close.  Everyone rides in silence.  Tension mounts. 
STEVE,"I got a call from the Secretary’s office.  I’m going to be running point on the scepter. Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. "
AGENT SITWELL,Sir?  I don’t understand- 
STEVE,"We’ve had word there might be an attempt to steal it. Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight. "
BROCK RUMLOW,"Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap. "
AGENT SITWELL,(pulling out his phone) I’ll have to check with the Director- 
STEVE,"No.  Trust me.  It’s okay... Steve leans in, drawing them all close.  Then he whispers: "
STEVE,"Hail Hydra. The elevator OPENS.  Steve steps out with THE SCEPTER. Sitwell and Rumlow stare after him, amazed. A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners in the tiny stairwell.  He snorts, growing more pissed off. "
A1 HULK,"SO MANY STAIRS! A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, followed by A1 THOR and LOKI. SWAT TROOPERS clear a path.  ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS "
TONY,"Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go. MOVE IN CLOSE on A1 TONY to see...SCOTT, HIDING IN HIS HAIR. "
SCOTT LANG,Bombs away. SCOTT slides down Tony’s clavicle to the RT.  He sniffs. 
SCOTT LANG,Is that...Axe body spray? 
TONY,"Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies.  Can we focus, please? "
SCOTT LANG,"I’m going inside you...NOW. A1 TONY, A1 THOR, and LOKI approach the door.  ALEXANDER PIERCE intercepts them with a team of SHIELD AGENTS. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Mind if I ask where you’re going? 
A1 THOR,"We were thinking lunch, then Asgard.  And you are? "
A1 TONY,"Alexander Pierce.  He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,My friends call me Mr. Secretary. (to Thor) I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me. 
A1 THOR,"Loki will answer to Odin, himself. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No, he’ll answer to us.  “Odin” can have what’s left. (to Tony) And we’ll need the case back, too. That’s been SHIELD property for over seventy years. "
A1 TONY,"I’m not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass... "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Just give me the case. Across the lobby, TONY OBSERVES FROM BEHIND HIS SWAT HELMET. "
TONY,"Move it, Stuart Little.  Things are getting dicey out here. Scott studies A TANGLE OF COPPER WIRING. "
SCOTT LANG,This place is a mess. (finding a wire) You promise you won’t die? 
TONY,You’re only giving me a minor cardiac dysrhythmia- 
SCOTT LANG,That doesn’t actually sound minor- Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY’S CASE. 
TONY,Window’s closing.  Pull my plug. 
SCOTT LANG,Here goes... 
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Stark? A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping.  THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND.  PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,MEDIC! 
A1 THOR,"Stark?  Somebody get some help!  Is it your chest machine? In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE.  He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD.  It SPINS across the floor... RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND.  Tony walks toward a side door. "
TONY,"Meet me in the alley.  I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s- The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open.  THE TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott... STOPPING AT LOKI’S FEET.  Loki stares at it in disbelief.  He glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid. THE TESSERACT...AND TELEPORTS AWAY.  Scott stares, stunned. "
SCOTT LANG,"That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it? "
A1 THOR,"WHERE’S LOKI? STEVE heads down a hall, SCEPTER IN HAND. "
SECURITY,"Building-wide alert, all units. Target Loki, maximum force. "
STEVE,Tony?  What’s going on?  Tell me you got that cube- 
A1 STEVE,"Strike Teams, clear Forty, then work down. Before Steve can hide...A1 STEVE ROUNDS THE CORNER. "
STEVE,"Oh, great. "
A1 STEVE,"Disregard.  I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor. "
STEVE,I’m not Loki.  And I don’t want to hurt you. 
A1 STEVE,You’re not going to get the chance- A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE.  Steve stumbles. 
STEVE,"Forgot about that one. They grapple.  Both their shields fall to the ground... THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms.  A1 Steve looks impressed. A1 STEVE SWINGS.  STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM.  A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off. "
A1 STEVE,I can do this all day- 
STEVE,"Yeah, I know... They battle on.  A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS: Steve goes cold.  He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED. "
A1 STEVE,Where’d you get this? 
STEVE,"PX.  Camp Lehigh.  1943. A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing. "
A1 STEVE,"You’ve got a lot of nerve. HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL.  Steve goes skidding.  He groans, looking up to see...HE’S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER. A1 STEVE moves in.  STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER to A1 Steve’s chest.  A1 STEVE’S EYES GO BLACK.  HE FREEZES. Steve stares, panting.  Finally, he picks up the compass from the floor, then considers A1 STEVE’S ASS. "
STEVE,"That is America’s ass. SMART HULK’S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a floppy sun hat covering his face. "
ANCIENT ONE,"I wish I could help you, Bruce... THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden.  She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through. "
ANCIENT ONE,"But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own. "
ASTRAL BANNER,"Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that. "
ANCIENT ONE,"And yet, you’re the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas. Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas.  He steps out of it. "
ASTRAL BANNER,"Lady, I just want to borrow your necklace- "
ANCIENT ONE,At what cost? 
ANCIENT ONE,"The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time.  Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits. She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, "
ANCIENT ONE,"Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not. "
ANCIENT ONE,"In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... "
ANCIENT ONE,"For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. (beat) Now tell me, Doctor.  Can your science prevent all that? "
ASTRAL BANNER,No.  But it can erase it. Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE. 
ASTRAL BANNER,"Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline.  At the moment it was taken.  So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left. "
ANCIENT ONE,"You’re leaving out the most important part, though.  In order to put the stones back, you’d have to survive. "
ASTRAL BANNER,We will.  I will.  I promise. 
ANCIENT ONE,I can’t risk this reality on a promise. 
ANCIENT ONE,It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone- 
ASTRAL BANNER,Yeah?  Then why the hell did Strange give it away? The Ancient One freezes. 
ANCIENT ONE,What did you say? 
ASTRAL BANNER,Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone. 
ANCIENT ONE,Willingly?  Why? 
ASTRAL BANNER,Don’t know.  Maybe he made a mistake. 
ANCIENT ONE,Or I did. The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. 
ANCIENT ONE,Strange is meant to be the best of us. 
ASTRAL BANNER,Then he must have had a reason. 
ANCIENT ONE,"I fear you may be right... Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH!  HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY.  Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY. "
SMART HULK,Thank you. 
ANCIENT ONE,"I’m counting on you, Bruce. (re. the city behind her) We all are. "
ANCIENT ONE,"BAD NEBULA HANGS SUSPENDED.  CABLES travel from her “brain” to a GLOWING WALL OF DATABANKS, which silhouettes... THANOS.  He regards her for a moment.  Then... "
THANOS,"Run diagnostics.  Show me her memory file. At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA’S INFORMATION. "
EBONY MAW,"Sir, the file appears...entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. (dawning on him) There’s another consciousness sharing her network.  Another Nebula. "
THANOS,Impossible. 
EBONY MAW,This duplicate carries a time stamp...from nine years in the future. 
THANOS,Where is this “other Nebula?” 
EBONY MAW,In our solar system.  On Morag. 
THANOS,Can you access her? 
EBONY MAW,Yes.  The two are linked. 
THANOS,Search the duplicate’s memory for Infinity Stones. Maw works the console.  Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA’S 
SMART HULK,-the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. 
TONY,Our history.  Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. 
CLINT BARTON,Which means we’ve got to pick our targets. 
STEVE,Exactly.  Let’s start here- 
THANOS,Freeze image. 
GAMORA,Terrans? 
THANOS,Avengers.  Unruly wretches. He gestures to A BLURRY REFLECTION WITHIN THE HOLOGRAM. 
THANOS,"What’s this reflection.  Amplify this, Maw. "
GAMORA,"I don’t understand.  Two Nebulas? Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces. "
THANOS,"No.  The same Nebula.  From two different times. (to Ebony Maw) Set course for Morag.  And scan the duplicate’s memories. (beat) I want to see everything... Frigga walks down a corridor, alone.  THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER.  She PAUSES, sensing something. Thor HIDES.  When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE.  Then he turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM.  Thor jumps. "
FRIGGA,What are you doing? 
THOR,Mother!  What?  Nothing.  Hello. 
FRIGGA,You’re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. (re. his bathrobe) What are you wearing? 
THOR,I always wear this.  It’s one of my favorites. 
FRIGGA,And what’s wrong with your eye? 
THOR,"Oh, that.  You remember the...Battle of Harokin.  I took a...broadsword to the face? He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom.  Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM. "
FRIGGA,"Oh.  You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you? "
THOR,"Yes, I am- "
FRIGGA,"I was raised by witches, boy.  I see with more than eyes, you know that. (eyeing him) I can see the future hasn’t been kind to you, has it? "
THOR,I didn’t say I was from the future... 
FRIGGA,"Thor... Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look.  Thor stares at his mom a long moment.  Then, he cracks: "
THOR,I’m totally from the future. 
FRIGGA,"Yes, you are. "
THOR,I need to talk to you. 
FRIGGA,"We can talk. Frigga GRABS Thor by the cloak and yanks him away. TILT UP TO FIND...JANE FOSTER.  She studies the outfit. Behind her, ROCKET RAISES THE EXTRACTION DEVICE OVER HIS FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers. "
THOR,...and then it was done.  His head over there.  Body over there.  And me in the middle.  Just an idiot with an axe. 
FRIGGA,"You’re no idiot.  You’re here, aren’t you?  Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard? "
THOR,"Yeah, I guess. "
FRIGGA,"An idiot, no.  A failure, absolutely. "
THOR,That’s a little harsh- 
FRIGGA,"Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it. "
THOR,"Okay, maybe just stop talking. "
FRIGGA,And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. 
THOR,"I’m not supposed to be like everyone else, though. "
FRIGGA,"Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor.  The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are. Thor stares at her, biting back emotions. "
THOR,"I’ve really missed you, Mum. "
ROCKET,I got it I got it I got it! THOR looks at THE OBSERVATORY: Dark Elves will soon attack. 
THOR,"Mum, I have to tell you something- "
FRIGGA,"No, son.  You don’t.  You’ve come to repair your future, not mine. "
THOR,But your future- 
FRIGGA,"Is none of my business. Thor stares at her, torn.  THEN ROCKET RACES INTO THE ROOM. "
ROCKET,"(to Frigga) Hi.  You must be Mom. (to Thor, re. the device) I got the thing.  Come on, we gotta move- Thor looks to Frigga. "
THOR,I wish we had more time- 
FRIGGA,"This was a gift.  Now, go be the man you’re meant to be. (beat) And eat a salad. Thor smiles.  He and Rocket activate their time suits. "
ROCKET,Three...two- 
THOR,No.  Wait. THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.  A long moment passes. 
ROCKET,What am I looking at? 
FRIGGA,"Sometimes it takes a second. Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND.  She grins, proud. "
THOR,(relieved) Still worthy. Mother and son look at each other for the last time. 
THOR,"Goodbye, Mum. "
FRIGGA,"Goodbye, Son. Suddenly...THE PALACE RUMBLES.  Frigga looks to the window, PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, dances through the ruins of an alien city. "
RHODEY,"So, he’s an idiot. "
NEBULA,"Yes. Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut.  When the horizon finally settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM. "
QUILL,"Oh, fu- BAM!  RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE.  Quill drops, out cold. "
RHODEY,Sorry about that.  I know you guys were teammates and everything. 
NEBULA,Do you hear me complaining? Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack.  She pulls out AN 
RHODEY,What is that? 
NEBULA,The tool of a thief.  Come on. They set out toward the RUINED CITY. 
RHODEY,"Hang on.  This would be about the time the spikes come out, you know, with the skeletons still on them? "
NEBULA,What are you talking about? 
RHODEY,"I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually... Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS "
RHODEY,"Traps and stuff. (Nebula steps inside) Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you. Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing. "
RHODEY,"These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix.  Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless we- She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER "
NEBULA,I wasn’t always like this. He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her.  Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens. 
RHODEY,"Yeah, me either.  I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh? "
RHODEY,"Let’s get out of here.  Place gives me the creeps.  Sync up.  Three... two...one... RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY.  Nebula goes for hers...BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK. SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL.  Her eyes snap open, projecting a hologram of...THANOS. "
THANOS,What’s wrong? 
BRUCE BANNER,You murdered trillions. 
THANOS,You should be grateful. 
NATASHA,Where are the stones? 
THANOS,Gone.  Reduced to atoms. 
BRUCE BANNER,You used them two days ago! 
THANOS,I used the stones to destroy the stones.  The work is done.  It always will be... 
THANOS,I AM INEVITABLE- 
THANOS,"I AM INEVITABLE. Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program.  THANOS WALKS "
GAMORA,What did you do to them? 
THANOS,Nothing.  Yet. (piecing it together) 
THANOS,They’re not trying to stop something I’m going to do in our time.  They’re trying to undo something I’ve already done in theirs. 
GAMORA,(uneasy) The stones. 
THANOS,I found them all.  I won.  Tipped the cosmic scales to balance. 
EBONY MAW,Sire.  This is your future? 
THANOS,"My destiny. He stares, mind whirling.  He nods.  THE MEMORY RESUMES. "
RHODEY,He’s lying. 
NEBULA,My father is many things.  A liar is not one of them. 
THANOS,"Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve treated you too- "
THANOS,"And that is destiny fulfilled. Gamora stares, torn.  But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos’ behalf. "
EBONY MAW,"Sire.  Your daughter is a traitor. AWAKENS, PANICKED.  She looks up at Thanos. "
BAD NEBULA,"(choking) No.  Please, father.  That’s not me.  I would never betray you. Please- "
THANOS,Thanos UNWRAPS the cord.  He touches his daughter’s face. 
THANOS,"Ssh, child.  I know.  And you’ll have the chance to prove it... "
NEBULA,He knows... NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK. 
NEBULA,"Barton, Romanoff, come in.  We have a problem.  Thanos knows!  Thanos- Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod.  Nebula looks out the cockpit window... IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building.  He hears A WHISTLE.  TONY waves from behind a crashed car. "
TONY,We’ve got a problem. STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT. 
STEVE,How could you lose it? 
TONY,What do you want?  I got hit in the head with a Hulk! 
SCOTT LANG,You said we only had one shot. This was our shot.  We shot it.  It was six stones or nothing!  Six stones- 
TONY,You’re not helping- 
SCOTT LANG,You ruined the Time Heist! 
TONY,"Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there.  Knows the restaurants.  It’s a safe bet he visits home.  If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly- "
STEVE,"Loki could be anywhere in the universe.  We’d be old men before we found him. As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING... "
STEVE,What other options did we have on the Tesseract? 
SCOTT LANG,"Whoa, whoa.  We don’t have any other options.  We can’t go to any other times.  No do-overs!  We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home. "
STEVE,"But if we don’t try, nobody else comes home, either. "
TONY,"I got it!  There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. (to Steve) Military installation, Garden State. Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. "
STEVE,When were they both there? 
TONY,I have a vaguely exact idea. 
STEVE,How vague? 
SCOTT LANG,"Hang on, what’s in New Jersey? "
TONY,"I know they were there, and I know how I know. "
STEVE,Looks like we’re improvising. 
SCOTT LANG,Wait!  What are you improvising? 
STEVE,"Scott, take this back to the Compound. "
TONY,"All right, suits on.  Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70... "
SCOTT LANG,"Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back. Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in.  He’s right. Even so, Tony turns to Steve. "
TONY,You trust me? 
STEVE,"I do. A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road.  The bumper sticker reads: “NUFF SAID.” At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side. He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD. "
STAN LEE,"Make love, not war, baby! He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: “U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - "
TONY,"You weren’t actually born here, right? Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE "
STEVE,The idea of me was. 
TONY,"(looking around) All right.  If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it? "
STEVE,"In plain sight. Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, “MUNITIONS.”  He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD. Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD She stares awkwardly at Tony.  Steve keeps his hat down. Ding.  The doors open.  Tony exits, then turns back to Steve. "
TONY,"Good luck with that mission, Captain. "
STEVE,"Good luck with your project, Doctor. Tony ducks out.  The doors close.  The Agent turns to Steve. "
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,You new here? 
STEVE,"Not exactly. TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES. "
TONY,"Come on, you little hexahedron, where are you hiding? Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE.  He grabs a briefcase, then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE’S LOCK. It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT.  Tony smiles. "
TONY,"You may not know it now, but someday you’re going to be a real pain-in-the-ass. Just then...THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS. "
HOWARD STARK,"Hey, Arnim, you in here? HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF "
HOWARD STARK,"Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola.  You seen him? "
TONY,"No.  Haven’t seen a soul. Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed.  Howard looks at him, a bit suspicious. "
HOWARD STARK,"I know you? From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH. He holds it out. "
TONY,"No, sir.  Just visiting from MIT. "
HOWARD STARK,That so?  Got a name? 
TONY,Howard... 
HOWARD STARK,Easy to remember- 
TONY,Potts. 
HOWARD STARK,"I’m Howard Stark. (shaking hands) You seem a little green around the gills, Potts.  Need some air? "
TONY,"That’d be swell. Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase. "
HOWARD STARK,Need the briefcase? CLOSE ON: AN ANT.  A phone continues to ring.  Then... 
HANK PYM,Hello? 
STEVE,Dr. Pym? 
HANK PYM,"That would be the number you called, yes. PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION. "
STEVE,"This is Captain Stevens, from shipping.  We have a package for you. KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET. "
HANK PYM,So bring it up. 
STEVE,"That’s the thing, sir, we can’t. ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20’s), in brown hair and lab coat. "
HANK PYM,Maybe I’m confused.  Isn’t that your job? 
STEVE,"It’s just...sir, the box is glowing.  And to be honest, a couple of our mail guys aren’t feeling great- "
HANK PYM,"They didn’t open it, did they?! A DOOR MARKED, “DR. HENRY PYM,” flies open.  Hank exits, fuming, brushing past...STEVE. Steve watches Hank stalk off...THEN DUCKS INTO HANK’S LAB. HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR.  The doors shut. "
TONY,Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big night planned? 
HOWARD STARK,(lifting one at a time) My wife’s expecting.  And too much time at the office. Tony puzzles the dates out in his head... 
TONY,Congratulations. 
HOWARD STARK,Thanks. 
TONY,How far along is she? 
HOWARD STARK,"Gee, I suppose... (indicating) ...this far.  She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing.  So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again. "
TONY,"I have a little girl. TONY SMILES.  He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born. "
HOWARD STARK,A girl would be nice.  Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me. 
TONY,Would that be so bad? 
HOWARD STARK,"Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest. The elevator doors open. STEVE searches Hank’s lab, finally opening the fridge to find...A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES. Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator.  But it opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P. "
M.P.,You’ve never seen either of these men before? 
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,No.  But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy. 
M.P.,Describe ‘fishy’. 
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,One of them had a hippie beard. 
M.P.,We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? 
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,Definitely Mungo Jerry. 
M.P.,"(over walkie-talkie) This is Chesler.  We need every available agent to sub-level 6.  We have a potential breach. Steve ducks through the nearest door... Steve enters a darkened office.  A glass wall separates it from another bullpen. Then he sees something on the desk.  He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.” Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him. Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN.  LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall. "
PEGGY CARTER,"So, send them in. "
MALE AGENT,"They’re trying, ma’am, but Braddock’s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. "
PEGGY CARTER,"Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections.  You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place.  Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain. "
MALE AGENT,"Yes, ma’am. Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED. Peggy rifles through a file cabinet. "
PEGGY CARTER,"Here we are... She flips through a file, reading.  In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches.  Peggy reads something disturbing. "
PEGGY CARTER,"Crikey O’Reilly. (calling out) Sergeant?  Hang up and call Air Command.  Braddock needs back up, immediately. "
MALE AGENT,Ma’am? 
PEGGY CARTER,Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at... She slaps the file closed and hurries out. Steve stares after her a long moment. Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. 
TONY,"Got any names, yet? "
HOWARD STARK,"If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. "
TONY,You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time. 
HOWARD STARK,"What are you, couple years older than me? "
TONY,Yeah.  I guess. 
HOWARD STARK,Let me ask you a question.  When your kid was born...were you nervous? 
TONY,Wildly. 
HOWARD STARK,Did you feel qualified?  Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? 
TONY,I pieced it together as I went along.  I thought about what my dad did... 
HOWARD STARK,My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt. 
TONY,"I tried to hold onto the good stuff.  Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there. "
HOWARD STARK,Like what? 
TONY,“No amount of money ever bought a second of time.” 
HOWARD STARK,That’s good.  Smart guy. 
TONY,He did his best. 
HOWARD STARK,"I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED.  Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door. "
HOWARD STARK,"Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack.  Isn’t that right? "
EDWIN JARVIS,"Indeed, sir.  I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo. Tony smiles at his old friend.  As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP.  TIME TO GO. Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand. "
HOWARD STARK,"Well, good to meet you, Potts. "
TONY,"You’re going to do fine, Howard. "
HOWARD STARK,Thanks.  See you around? 
TONY,"Count on it... As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis. "
HOWARD STARK,Have we met him before? 
EDWIN JARVIS,"We’ve met a lot of people, sir. "
HOWARD STARK,"Seems very familiar. (beat) Weird beard. The Sanctuary-2 cruises ominously through space. WHACK!  NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.  She gets to her knees, looking up at...BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER. "
BAD NEBULA,You’re weak. 
NEBULA,I’m you- 
BAD NEBULA,"Shut up! THEN GAMORA ENTERS.  Nebula softens, taking in her (once dead) sister. "
NEBULA,You could stop this.  You know you want to. (off Gamora’s look) Did you see what happens in the future?  Thanos finds the Soul Stone. 
NEBULA,You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you- 
BAD NEBULA,ENOUGH! 
BAD NEBULA,You disgust me...but that doesn’t mean you’re useless. Gamora takes in this new development... Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne.  She hands him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS.  He smiles. Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head. 
BAD NEBULA,"How do I look? THE BENATAR approaches Vormir. NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE "
CLINT BARTON,"Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome. Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune. Clint fires a Pym Particle. WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS.  CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket. Natasha and Clint climb, ragged.  They approach AN ARCHWAY. "
CLINT BARTON,Really starting to regret my choice here. 
NATASHA,Yeah.  I’m gonna bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain. 
CLINT BARTON,I don’t think technically he’s a raccoon... 
NATASHA,Whatever.  He eats garbage- 
HOODED FIGURE,"I assure you, you have nothing to fear from me. "
CLINT BARTON,Creepy. 
HOODED FIGURE,"Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith. "
CLINT BARTON,Creepier. 
NATASHA,Who are you? 
RED SKULL,"Consider me a guide.  To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone. "
NATASHA,"Great.  You show us where it is, and we’ll be on our way. The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL. "
RED SKULL,"Oh, liebchen.  If only it were that easy... START ON JAGGED ROCKS.  TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and CLINT staring down from the ALTAR. "
RED SKULL,What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear. 
NATASHA,The Stone is down there? 
RED SKULL,"For one of you.  For the other... (smiling it away) The Stone demands a sacrifice.  In order to take it, you must leave behind that which you love. "
RED SKULL,"A soul for a soul. Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned. RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind. "
CLINT BARTON,Maybe he’s full of shit. 
NATASHA,I don’t think so. 
CLINT BARTON,"Why, because he knew your daddy’s name? "
NATASHA,"I didn’t. (off his look) Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter.  You really think that’s a coincidence? They both look out at the well, heavy. "
NATASHA,(under her breath) Whatever it takes... 
CLINT BARTON,"(under his breath) Whatever it takes... Natasha goes to Clint, resolved. "
NATASHA,"If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. "
CLINT BARTON,Then I guess we both know who it has to be. 
NATASHA,Yeah.  Guess we do. They take each other’s hand.  A long goodbye beat.  Except... 
CLINT BARTON,I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person. 
NATASHA,"For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here.  This is all it’s been about.  Bringing everybody back. "
CLINT BARTON,Do not get all decent on me- 
NATASHA,"You think I want to do it?  I’m trying to save your life, you idiot- "
CLINT BARTON,And I don’t want you to. (beat) Nat.  You know what I’ve done. What I am now.  Your life’s worth ten of mine- 
NATASHA,I don’t judge people by their worst mistakes- 
CLINT BARTON,Maybe you should- 
NATASHA,"You didn’t. That stops him.  He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in. "
CLINT BARTON,"You’re a pain in my ass, you know that? She relaxes for the briefest moment.  Just then, CLINT SWEEPS "
CLINT BARTON,Tell my family I love them. 
NATASHA,"Tell them yourself. --- Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff.  Just as he falls... NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR.  They drop, but NATASHA THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE.  She attaches the other end of her grappling line to Clint’s belt...saving his life. She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers. "
CLINT BARTON,"Damn you. They hang there a long, terrible moment.  CLINT’S GRASP STARTS TO LOOSEN.  Finally, she looks him in the eye. "
NATASHA,Let me go. 
CLINT BARTON,"No.  Please no... The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them. "
NATASHA,It’s okay... 
CLINT BARTON,"Natasha, no- Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out of Clint’s grasp. She falls... Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, helpless, stifling his scream. When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE.  The camera rotates until we see...IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY. CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN.  He sits up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE.  His eyes well. Everyone looks around, exhausted.  Amazed. "
RHODEY,Are you telling me that actually worked? 
SMART HULK,"Did we get them all? CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES.  Steve turns, concerned. "
STEVE,"Clint?  Are you okay? Clint stares, haunted.  SMART HULK realizes... "
SMART HULK,"Where’s Nat? (everyone stares) WHERE’S NAT?! Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy. SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock. Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING. "
TONY,Do we know if she had family? 
STEVE,"Yeah.  Us. Thor turns, thrown. "
THOR,Why are you doing that? 
TONY,I’m just asking a question- 
THOR,"Why are we talking as if she’s dead?  We have the stones.  Bring her back.  C’mon, stop this shit. Clint squeezes away tears. "
CLINT BARTON,We can’t get her back. 
THOR,"What’s he talking about?  Of course, we can. "
CLINT BARTON,It can’t be undone.  That’s why. 
THOR,"No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being.  We’re talking about space magic, here.  “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think? "
CLINT BARTON,"Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she? "
THOR,That’s my point- 
CLINT BARTON,"It can’t be undone.  At least that’s what the red, floating guy said.  But why don’t you go talk to him, okay?  Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. (beat) It was supposed to be me.  She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.  She bet her life on it. That lands heavily on all of them.  A moment passes. THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER.  It skips across the surface like a stone. "
SMART HULK,She’s not coming back.  We have to make it worth it.  We have to. 
STEVE,"We will. ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass.  SOON, TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch. The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN Smart Hulk releases a deep breath. THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES EMBEDDED IN THE BACK.  Pull back to find... SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND "
ROCKET,"All right.  The glove’s ready. Question is, who’s gonna snap their freaking fingers? Everyone stares a beat.  Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET. "
THOR,I’ll do it. 
TONY,"Whoa, whoa, what are you doing- "
STEVE,"Thor, we haven’t decided who’s putting that on. "
THOR,Oh.  Were all of you just waiting for the right opportunity? 
ROCKET,Maybe I was getting around to it- 
SCOTT LANG,We should at least discuss it- 
THOR,"Staring at the thing isn’t going to bring everybody back, is it?  Look, I’m the strongest Avenger.  It’s my responsibility.  Fate wills it so. "
TONY,"Hold on, hold on- "
THOR,Stop it!  Let me do this.  Let me do something good.  Something right- 
TONY,That thing is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. You’re in no condition- 
THOR,What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? 
RHODEY,Cheez Whiz? 
THOR,Lightning. Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet. 
SMART HULK,"Lightning won’t help you, pal. It’s gotta be me. (approaching) You saw what those stones did to Thanos.  They almost killed him. None of you could survive. "
STEVE,And how do we know you can? 
SMART HULK,"We don’t.  But the radiation’s mostly gamma. (beat) It’s like I was made for this... THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS.  Then, clack, the lights come on, revealing... --- SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET.  The moment of truth. "
TONY,Good to go? 
SMART HULK,Let’s do it. 
TONY,"Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you’re just bringing them back...to today. Don’t change anything from the last five years.  Got it? "
SMART HULK,"Got it. PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves: STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm.  SCOTT deploys his helmet.  RHODEY readies his repulsors. ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR.  TONY armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him. "
TONY,"Friday, why don’t you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol? "
SMART HULK,(under his breath) Everybody’s coming home... 
THOR,"What’s happening?  Take it off, take if off! "
STEVE,"Bruce, you okay? "
TONY,"Talk to me, Banner. "
SMART HULK,"I’m...okay... NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE.  She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM.  THIS IS BAD NEBULA. INTO THE CONSOLE.  THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. EVERYONE RUSHES OVER.  Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse. "
STEVE,Bruce! 
TONY,"Don’t move him! Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING. SCOTT walks toward the courtyard. Smart Hulk’s eyes clear.  He grasps Steve’s arm. "
SMART HULK,"Did it work? They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them. A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE.  On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.” "
CLINT BARTON,Honey? 
SCOTT LANG,"Guys, I think it- Nothing moves.  The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE.  Avengers Compound has been destroyed. Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds.  It hovers over the ruins like a vulture. AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS.  The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought. "
THANOS,Daughter? 
BAD NEBULA,"Yes, father... OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA.  Bruised and dirty. "
THANOS,So this is the future.  Well done. She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE. 
BAD NEBULA,"Thank you, Father.  They suspected nothing. "
THANOS,"The arrogant never do. Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge. "
THANOS,Go.  Find the stones.  Bring them to me. 
BAD NEBULA,What will you do? 
THANOS,Wait. 
RHODEY,Canopy!  Canopy! Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN.  HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE.  AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... 
RHODEY,"Mayday!  Tony.  Cap.  Does anybody hear me?! HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET.  Rocket wheezes, in pain. "
RHODEY,Hang on! finally managing to lever it off of Rocket.  THEN... 
RHODEY,"Mayday!  Mayday!  We are taking on water! CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR. "
RHODEY,"...anyone...Mayday...Mayday- Scott groans, coming to. "
SCOTT LANG,"Wait, what...? "
ROCKET,Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses up- 
RHODEY,...trapped...drowning...no time... Scott jumps to his feet. 
SCOTT LANG,"No!  Wait, I’m here! Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR. TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN.  He groans. He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN.  “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.”  Clint stares, amazed. He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET.  It’s bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM. "
CLINT BARTON,"Cap?  Stark?  Anyone? STATIC.  Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT. He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow. HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold.  SOMEONE SHAKES HIM. He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD. "
TONY,"You lose this again, I’m keeping it. "
STEVE,What happened? 
TONY,"Told you.  We messed with time. Time messed back. Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab. "
STEVE,Where are the others? 
TONY,"I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell. They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT...THANOS.  Sitting on a rock.  Waiting. "
TONY,What’s he been doing? 
THOR,"Absolutely nothing. The three of them stare a long moment.  Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY. "
STEVE,Son of a bitch. 
TONY,Yeah. 
STEVE,Where are the stones? 
TONY,Somewhere under all of this.  All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em. 
STEVE,So we keep it that way. That lands.  This is their chance. 
THOR,You know it’s a trap. 
TONY,Don’t think I care. 
THOR,Just so we’re all in agreement. Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT.  He holds out his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM. 
THOR,"Let’s kill him properly this time. Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative. "
THANOS,You could not live with your own failure.  And where did that bring you?  Right back to me. 
THANOS,"I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. (beat) Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails.  As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be.  They will resist. "
TONY,Yep.  We’re all kinds of stubborn. 
THANOS,I’m thankful.  Because now I know what I must do. Thanos reaches for his helmet. 
THANOS,I will shred this universe down to its last atom. 
THANOS,"And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given.  A grateful universe. "
STEVE,Born out of blood. Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time. 
THANOS,They’ll never know it. 
THANOS,Because you won’t be alive to tell them. Tony glances over at Steve.  Ready?  Steve nods... NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL.  After a beat...THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN.  She stares into the shadows. 
NEBULA,What do you want? 
GAMORA,In the future...what happens to you and me? 
NEBULA,"I try to kill you.  Several times. But, eventually...we become friends.  We become sisters. "
GAMORA,That’s hard to believe. 
THANOS,
NEBULA,A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe. Gamora nearly smiles.  She takes a long look at Nebula. Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND. 
GAMORA,Come on.  We can still stop him. Nebula takes a deciding moment.  Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S HAND.  One sister pulls the other to her feet. 
SMART HULK,Rhodey.  Rocket.  Get out of here. Save yourselves. 
ROCKET,"No good.  Couldn’t even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through. Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT.  His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight. Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS. "
SMART HULK,AAARRRGH! 
RHODEY,MAYDAY!  MAYDAY! 
SCOTT LANG,"HANG ON!  I’M COMING! Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT. A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him. Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides. Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as... HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER.  He gasps, safe.  Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM. "
CLINT BARTON,"Oh, hey.  I know you. She gently takes the Gauntlet. "
BAD NEBULA,Father.  I have the stones. 
CLINT BARTON,"What- Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD... "
GAMORA,Stop. 
BAD NEBULA,You’re betraying us? 
GAMORA,"Not you. GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating. Bad Nebula stares at her future self. "
NEBULA,You don’t have to do this. 
BAD NEBULA,I am this. 
GAMORA,No.  You’re not. Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward.  She taps her head. 
NEBULA,You’ve seen what we become- 
GAMORA,"Sister, listen to her- "
BAD NEBULA,Shut up.  You’re a traitor! 
NEBULA,"You can change. Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace. "
BAD NEBULA,"He won’t let me. Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused. "
CLINT BARTON,I’m not even gonna ask. 
FRIDAY,Boss?  Wake up! 
RHODEY,"See you on the other side, man. They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING. Steve slashes at Thanos.  The Titan brutally bats him aside. Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris. Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it.  He presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home. Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR. Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS. Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR. "
THOR,"I...knew...it... Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm. "
THANOS,In all my years of conquest... Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand. 
THANOS,Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal. Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES. 
THANOS,"But I’ll tell you now, the things I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet... "
THANOS,"I’m going to enjoy it.  Very, very much. Steve stares at Thanos and his army.  And even in the face of such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet. THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM. One man against thousands.  All alone. But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES.  He strains to hear. The com crackles again.  We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE. "
MUFFLED VOICE,"-ap-...-comin-...-ot- Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it.  Slowly, SOUND "
SAM WILSON,"Cap.  On your left. Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry. Wong and Strange quickly find each other. "
DR. STRANGE,Is that everyone? 
WONG,You wanted more?! 
SCOTT LANG,"Top floor, everybody out! "
STEVE,"Avengers...assemble. DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life out of KORG. TONY blasts overhead.  RESCUE joins him.  Together, they strafe the field. STEVE and THOR fight together.  Both hold out their hands. Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns. "
THOR,"No.  You take the little one. Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS.  One knocks him into an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when... THWIP.  PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT.  SQUISH. Tony stares at Peter, emotional.  They retract their helmets. "
PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark.  Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on.  Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty?  I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.”  And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does- But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s face into his chest plate. "
PETER PARKER,"(muffled) Oh.  This is nice. ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers.  One leaps off an outcropping... Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike. THEN BLAM!  The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill. He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING.  Quill stares, amazed. "
QUILL,Gamora? 
QUILL,"I thought I lost you. He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts. Twice.  He goes down, gasping. "
QUILL,You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time. She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER. 
GAMORA,This is the one?  Seriously? 
NEBULA,Your choices were him or a tree. CHITAURI APE.  Just before the ape tramples Clint... Clint runs on.  The heroes confer over coms. 
CLINT BARTON,What do you want to do with this thing? 
STEVE,Get those stones as far away as possible! 
SMART HULK,No!  We need to send them back where they came from. 
TONY,There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine. 
SCOTT LANG,"Hold on! (shrinking to normal size) That wasn’t our only time machine. He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN.  From a distance, we hear, “LA CUCARACHA.”  Steve immediately gets it. "
STEVE,"Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there? "
VALKYRIE,Yeah.  But you’re not going to like where it’s parked. 
TONY,"Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working? "
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, maybe ten minutes. "
STEVE,Get it started.  We’ll get the stones to you. 
HOPE VAN DYNE,"We’re on it, Cap. SCOTT glances at her.  Cap?  THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY. "
TONY,Doc.  You said we win one in 14 million.  Is this how it goes down? 
DR. STRANGE,"If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen. "
TONY,You better be right. Tony rockets away.  Strange coolly watches him go. 
EBONY MAW,"Sire, the stones! "
T’CHALLA,"Clint, give it to me. They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat.  Out the windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS. "
SCOTT LANG,(digging around) Ignition’s broken.  I’ll hotwire it- 
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Wait, you know how to do that? Scott splices wires.  Sparks fly. "
SCOTT LANG,I was in prison.  I know how to do a lot of things. 
WANDA,You took everything from me. Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back. 
THANOS,I don’t even know who you are. 
WANDA,You will. 
PETER PARKER,I GOT IT! GAUNTLET...THWIP!  Peter snatches it out of the air. 
PETER PARKER,"Activate instant kill! His robotic arms slash with expert precision. Thanos groans, outmatched. "
THANOS,Rain fire.  Wipe them all out. 
CORVUS GLAIVE,"But, sire, our troops- "
THANOS,"Just do it! BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... "
PEPPER POTTS,"Um, is anyone else seeing this? TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders. "
PETER PARKER,I got this...I got this...I don’t got this. 
STEVE,"Hey, Queens!  Heads up! "
PEPPER POTTS,"Hang on, kid.  I’ve got you. She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE "
PETER PARKER,"Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg! Rocket and Groot dive for cover.  Groot wraps his branches around them both. "
ROCKET,At least we’re going out together this time... SAM WILSON flies overhead. 
SAM WILSON,What the hell is this? 
TONY,"Friday, what are they firing at? "
FRIDAY,Something just entered the upper atmosphere. Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH. 
GROOT,"(nervous) I am Groot. Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming. "
ROCKET,Just wait for it. 
ROCKET,"Oh, yeah! "
STEVE,Danvers!  We’re gonna need an assist down here! 
CAROL DANVERS,"(under ragged breath) Roger...Rogers... Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it. "
SCOTT LANG,I’m almost there.  Where’s the glove? 
PETER PARKER,"Uh, hey.  I’m Peter Parker. "
CAROL DANVERS,"Hey, Peter Parker.  You got something for me? Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde. "
PETER PARKER,I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that- 
WANDA,"Don’t worry, kid... Peter turns to see... WAITING.  Wanda’s hands begin to glow. "
OKOYE,"She’s got help. Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT. AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING "
SCOTT LANG,"Thirty seconds! Thanos understands immediately.  HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR The problem is...SO DOES THANOS. Tony gets to his knees, realizing... The Avengers are going to lose. STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE.  He looks to Tony... Tony meets his eye.  And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger.  “One.” "
THANOS,"I am...inevitable. THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS.  But nothing happens.  Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, "
TONY,"And I...am Iron Man. DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE.  He watches as... ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE. "
QUILL,"Babe?  Gamora? Dying. LATE.  TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO.  Then... PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand. "
PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won.  You did it, sir... But Tony gazes past him.  Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder, guiding him away... AS PEPPER ARRIVES.  She kneels, heartsick. "
PEPPER POTTS,"Hey, Friday, what’ve we got? "
FRIDAY,Life functions critical. Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows. 
PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, look at me.  We’re going to be okay... He stares at her, tears welling.  I’m sorry. She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him. "
PEPPER POTTS,"You can rest now. When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy. Everything goes quiet.  All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what’s happened dawning on them. Tony Stark is gone. PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students.  He searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS. As they embrace... Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco. "
TONY,"Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way.  Maybe this time. On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning. TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE.  Then the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out. "
TONY,"I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration. "
TONY,"I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.  If there ever was such a thing. She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky. ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA.  Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset. "
TONY,"God, what a world.  Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised.  But come on... The Quinjet touches down.  The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT.  He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed. "
TONY,"Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. They throw themselves into his arms.  He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes.  Finally, he looks up to see... LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL’S HAND.  Clint gathers them all into a hug. A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table. "
TONY,"That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part. "
TONY,
TONY,"I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all.  But that’s the hero gig, right?  Part of the journey is the end. REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching. "
TONY,What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to. HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and Morgan in particular. 
TONY,"I love you 3000. He switches off the camera, vanishing. Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead. PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS.  The Avengers follow, somber. CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.” Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN... PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL... PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE... PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY... PAST T’CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, "
TONY,"PAST STRANGE and WONG... PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET... PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER... PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY. LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake.  WANDA approaches. "
CLINT BARTON,I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it. 
WANDA,She knows.  They both do. Clint puts his arm around her.  They stare out at the water. 
HAPPY HOGAN,"How are you doing, squirt?  You hungry? "
MORGAN STARK,"Uh, huh. "
HAPPY HOGAN,What do you want? 
MORGAN STARK,"Cheeseburgers? Happy takes a beat, choked up.  Like father like daughter. "
HAPPY HOGAN,Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers? 
MORGAN STARK,"No, I didn’t know that. "
HAPPY HOGAN,I’m going to get you all the cheeseburgers you want. THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD. 
VALKYRIE,So when can we expect you back? 
THOR,About that... 
VALKYRIE,"Thor, your people need a king. "
THOR,They already have one.  And she’s a far better king than I could ever be. 
VALKYRIE,Are you serious? 
THOR,"It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be.  And a leader is who you are. She processes this.  Does she want it?  She does. "
VALKYRIE,"You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here. "
THOR,"I’m counting on it, Your Majesty. Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND. "
VALKYRIE,What will you do? 
THOR,"I’m not entirely sure.  For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. (beat) But I do have a ride. REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside. "
ROCKET,"Move it or lose it, Hairbag. THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar.  QUILL, MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines. "
THOR,"Home sweet home.  Tree!  Good to see you.  The Asgardians of the Galaxy, together again. He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. "
THOR,"All right, where first? He swipes through images on the screen. "
QUILL,"You know, I’m still in charge, here, right? "
THOR,Of course.  Of course... Thor swipes the map again. 
QUILL,"See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-” "
THOR,"Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up. "
DRAX,You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. 
NEBULA,Sounds fair. 
QUILL,That’s not necessary... 
ROCKET,I’ve got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives. 
MANTIS,"Oh, yes, please, use knives- "
QUILL,No one’s using knives! 
GROOT,I am Groot! Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter. 
THOR,There’ll be no knifing young Quail today.  Everyone knows who’s in charge. A long awkward moment passes. 
QUILL,"Me. (sotto, to Thor) Right? Thor just smiles... The ship rises.  WHOOSH.  IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS. COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments.  He finally opens A CASE: "
SMART HULK,"Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken.  Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities. "
STEVE,Got it.  I’ll clip all the branches. Steve takes the case. 
SMART HULK,"You know, I tried.  When I had the gauntlet.  I really tried to bring her back. (beat) I miss her. "
STEVE,"Me, too. "
SMART HULK,You’d better get going.  We’re almost ready for you. Steve and Sam approach the platform. 
SAM WILSON,"You look a little nervous going by yourself.  Ask nicely, I’ll go with you. "
STEVE,"You’re a good man, Sam.  But this one’s on me. When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed. "
STEVE,"Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay? "
BUCKY BARNES,How can I?  You’re taking all the stupid with you. Steve grins.  Bucky gives him a long hug. 
BUCKY BARNES,"Gonna miss you, buddy. "
STEVE,"It’s going to be okay, Buck. Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform. "
SAM WILSON,How long’s this gonna take? 
SMART HULK,"For him, as long as he needs.  For us, five seconds. (calling out) Ready, Cap?  You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay? Steve glances at Bucky as he answers. "
STEVE,You bet. 
SMART HULK,"Going Quantum in three, two, one. "
SMART HULK,"Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...one- Silence.  Nothing happens. "
SAM WILSON,Where is he? 
SMART HULK,I don’t know.  He blew past our time stamp.  He should be here. 
SAM WILSON,Get him back! 
SMART HULK,I’m trying. 
SAM WILSON,Get him the hell back- 
SMART HULK,I’M TRYING! Just then...Bucky looks out to the water. 
BUCKY BARNES,"Sam. Sam turns... Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river. There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson. Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY. "
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap. The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112. "
OLD STEVE,"Hi, Sam. "
SAM WILSON,Something go wrong...or something go right? 
OLD STEVE,"I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get. "
SAM WILSON,"How was it? Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face. "
OLD STEVE,It was beautiful. 
SAM WILSON,I’m happy for you.  Really. 
OLD STEVE,Thanks. 
SAM WILSON,"Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America. Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam. "
OLD STEVE,"That’s kind of why I’m here. Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD. "
SAM WILSON,Where did you even get this? 
OLD STEVE,"I had a little time to travel. (beat) Try it on. Sam hesitates.  He glances back at Bucky, who nods.  Then Sam picks up the shield...and puts it on. "
OLD STEVE,How does it feel? 
SAM WILSON,Like it’s someone else’s. 
OLD STEVE,It isn’t. Sam tries to check his emotion.  He shakes Steve’s hand. 
SAM WILSON,Thank you.  I’ll try my best. Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s. 
OLD STEVE,"That’s why it’s yours. Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING. "
SAM WILSON,"You gonna tell me about her? Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life. "
OLD STEVE,"Nope.  I don’t think I will. A PACKARD rolls down a block of WASHINGTON D.C. ROW HOUSES. Find a red house in the middle of the block.  Move up the steps to the front door...WHICH HANGS WIDE OPEN. A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood.  We hear Harry James.  Move into the living room...past the record player... TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN.  They rock back and forth barely moving.  As they turn, we see... PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face.  He steps on her toe.  She laughs.  As they turn, we get a good look at... Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he deserves. All rights reserved. Copyright © 2019 Marvel.
