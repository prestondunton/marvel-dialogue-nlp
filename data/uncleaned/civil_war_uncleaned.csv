VASILY KARPOV,"Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать. Рассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на родину. Один. Грузовой вагон. ( Longing. Rusted. Seventeen. Daybreak. Furnace. Nine. Benign. Homecoming. One. Freight car.) Доброе утро, Солдат. ( Good morning, Soldier.)"
BUCKY BARNES,Я готов отвечать. ( Ready to comply.)
VASILY KARPOV,У меня есть для тебя миссия. Санкционируй и Извлекай. Без свидетелей.( I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses.)
VASILY KARPOV,"Отлично, Солдат. ( Well done, Soldier.)"
STEVE ROGERS,"All right, what do you see?"
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
STEVE ROGERS,"There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . ."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Cameras.
STEVE ROGERS,Both cross streets are one way.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"So, compromised escape routes."
STEVE ROGERS,"Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?"
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Yeah, the red one? It’s cute."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
SAM WILSON,Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
STEVE ROGERS,"Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him."
SAM WILSON,If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
STEVE ROGERS,"Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it."
SAM WILSON,Give me X-ray.
SAM WILSON,That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s a battering ram.
STEVE ROGERS,Go now.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What?
STEVE ROGERS,He’s not hitting the police.
STEVE ROGERS,"Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles."
SAM WILSON,I make 5.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Sam.
SAM WILSON,Four.
SAM WILSON,Rumlow’s on the third floor.
STEVE ROGERS,"Wanda, just like we practiced."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What about the gas?
STEVE ROGERS,Get it out.
BROCK RUMLOW,Pack it up.
BROCK RUMLOW,He’s here.
STEVE ROGERS,Rumlow has a biological weapon.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,(on radio) I’m on it.
BROCK RUMLOW,I don't work like that no more.
BROCK RUMLOW,Fire in the hole.
MERCENARY,No!
STEVE ROGERS,Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
BROCK RUMLOW,Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
MERCENARY #1,Where are you going to meet us?
BROCK RUMLOW,I’m not.
SAM WILSON,"I got four, they're splitting up."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I got the two on the left.
STEVE ROGERS,They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
BROCK RUMLOW,"There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!"
SAM WILSON,He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Out of the way!
MERCENARY #1,Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!
MERCENARY #2,He'll do it!
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Payload secure. Thanks, Sam."
SAM WILSON,Don't thank me.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’m… not thanking that thing.
SAM WILSON,His name is Redwing.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm still not thanking it.
SAM WILSON,"He's cute. Go ahead, pet him."
BROCK RUMLOW,Come on!
BROCK RUMLOW,This is for dropping a building on my face.
BROCK RUMLOW,"I think I look pretty good, all things considered."
STEVE ROGERS,Who's your buyer?
BROCK RUMLOW,"You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky."
STEVE ROGERS,What did you say?
BROCK RUMLOW,"He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, ""Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go."" And you're coming with me."
STEVE ROGERS,Oh my . . .  Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.
MARIA STARK,"Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . .  Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father."
HOWARD STARK,Who's the homeless person on the couch?
YOUNG TONY STARK,This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
MARIA STARK,"Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad."
HOWARD STARK,"Really, which broad? What's her name?"
YOUNG TONY STARK,Candice.
HOWARD STARK,Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
YOUNG TONY STARK,"Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?"
MARIA STARK,You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
HOWARD STARK,We might have to make a quick stop.
YOUNG TONY STARK,"At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary."
HOWARD STARK,"You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags."
MARIA STARK,"He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it."
YOUNG TONY STARK,"I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could."
TONY STARK,"That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh."
TONY STARK,"It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it."
TONY STARK,"Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? ""To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke."
TONY STARK,"Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded."
TONY STARK,"No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now."
TONY STARK,Go break some eggs.
MIT TEACHER,"Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, ""Ooh, gross,"" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . ."
TONY STARK,"Restroom's this way, yeah?"
MIT TEACHER,Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
STARK'S ASSISTANT,"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it."
TONY STARK,It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT TEACHER,We'll catch up later.
MRS. SPENCER,"That was nice, what you did for those young people."
TONY STARK,"Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience."
MRS. SPENCER,They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
TONY STARK,Are you going up?
MRS. SPENCER,I'm right where I want to be.
TONY STARK,"Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard."
MRS. SPENCER,I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
MRS SPENCER,His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
MRS SPENCER,"Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you."
NEWS ANCHOR #1,"11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred."
KING T'CHAKA,"Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."
NEWS ANCHOR #1,The Wakanda king went on to . . .
NEWS ANCHOR #2,"They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these."
,
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's my fault.
STEVE ROGERS,That's not true.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
STEVE ROGERS,I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
STEVE ROGERS,"Rumlow said ""Bucky"" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn."
STEVE ROGERS,And people died. It's on me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's on both of us.
STEVE ROGERS,"This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis! We talked about this.
VISION,"Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . ."
VISION,Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you. We'll be right down.
VISION,"I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest."
STEVE ROGERS,We know who it is?
VISION,The Secretary of State.
SECRETARY ROSS,"Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word ""vigilantes""."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?"
SECRETARY ROSS,"How about ""dangerous""? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?"
SECRETARY ROSS,New York.
SECRETARY ROSS,Washington DC.
SECRETARY ROSS,Sokovia.
SECRETARY ROSS,Lagos.
STEVE ROGERS,Okay. That's enough.
SECRETARY ROSS,"For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution."
SECRETARY ROSS,"The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary."
STEVE ROGERS,The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
SECRETARY ROSS,"Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?"
SECRETARY ROSS,"If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground."
JAMES RHODES,"So, there are contingencies."
SECRETARY ROSS,"Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords."
SECRETARY ROSS,Talk it over.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,And if we come to a decision you don't like?
SECRETARY ROSS,Then you retire.
HELMUT ZEMO,Hello? Is this your car out front?
HELMUT ZEMO,I jumped the curb.
HELMUT ZEMO,"Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess."
VASILY KARPOV,No. No cops.
HELMUT ZEMO,Thank you.
HELMUT ZEMO,"You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations."
HELMUT ZEMO,"""Mission report: December 16, 1991."""
VASILY KARPOV,Who are you?
HELMUT ZEMO,"My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991."
VASILY KARPOV,How did you find me?
HELMUT ZEMO,"When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those."
VASILY KARPOV,What do you want?
HELMUT ZEMO,Mission report. December 16. 1991.
VASILY KARPOV,Go . . . to . . . hell.
HELMUT ZEMO,HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
VASILY KARPOV,Hail HYDRA.
JAMES RHODES,"Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have."
SAM WILSON,So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
JAMES RHODES,"A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, ""No, that's cool. We got it. """
SAM WILSON,How long are you going to play both sides?
VISION,I have an equation.
SAM WILSON,"Oh, this will clear it up."
VISION,"In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate."
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying it's our fault?
VISION,I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
JAMES RHODES,Boom.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
STEVE ROGERS,It's because he's already made up his mind.
TONY STARK,"Boy, you know me so well."
TONY STARK,"Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache."
TONY STARK,"That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?"
TONY STARK,"Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia."
TONY STARK,"He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass."
TONY STARK,"There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys."
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up."
TONY STARK,Who said we're giving up?
STEVE ROGERS,We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
JAMES RHODES,"I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA."
STEVE ROGERS,"No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change."
TONY STARK,"That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing."
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own."
TONY STARK,"If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying they'll come for me.
VISION,We would protect you.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Maybe Tony's right.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -"
SAM WILSON,Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
TONY STARK,"Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, I want to take it back now."
TONY STARK,"No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win."
STEVE ROGERS,I have to go.
PRIEST,"And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words."
SHARON CARTER,Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
SHARON CARTER,"She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related."
SHARON CARTER,"I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say "" No, you move."""
STEVE ROGERS,"When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"She had you back, too."
STEVE ROGERS,Who else signed?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
STEVE ROGERS,Clint?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Says he's retired.
STEVE ROGERS,Wanda?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
STEVE ROGERS,What are we giving up to do it?
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know.
STEVE ROGERS,Then what are you doing here?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't want you to be alone.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come here.
NEWS ANCHOR #3,At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
UN STAFFER,"Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yes?
UN STAFFER,These need your signature.  Thank you.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thanks.
T'CHALLA,I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, well, it's not always so flattering."
T'CHALLA,You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, I'm not."
T'CHALLA,"That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why? You don't approve of all this?
T'CHALLA,"The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred."
KING T'CHAKA,Unless you need to move a piano.
T'CHALLA,Father.
KING T'CHAKA,Son. Miss Romanoff.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria."
KING T'CHAKA,Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yes, so am I."
MAN ON SPEAKERS,If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
T'CHALLA,That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thank you.
KING T'CHAKA,"For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it."
T'CHALLA,"I'm happy, Father."
KING T'CHAKA,Thank you.
T'CHALLA,Thank you.
KING T'CHAKA,"When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative.  Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace."
T'CHALLA,EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
SHARON CARTER,"My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster."
STEVE ROGERS,Very practical.
SHARON CARTER,And stylish.
STEVE ROGERS,CIA has you stationed over here now?
SHARON CARTER,"In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force."
STEVE ROGERS,Right. Right. Sounds fun.
SHARON CARTER,"I know, right?"
STEVE ROGERS,I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
SHARON CARTER,You mean when I was doing my job.
STEVE ROGERS,Did Peggy know?
SHARON CARTER,She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you.  Thanks for walking me back.
STEVE ROGERS,Sure.
SAM WILSON,Steve. There's something you gotta see.
NEWS ANCHOR #4,A bomb hidden in a news van . . .
SHARON CARTER,Who's coordinating?
NEWS ANCHOR #4,. . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.
SHARON CARTER,Good. They're solid. Forensics?
NEWS ANCHOR #4,"More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations."
SHARON CARTER,I have to go to work.
SHARON CARTER,"Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm very sorry.
T'CHALLA,"In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,That sounds very peaceful.
T'CHALLA,My father thought so.  I am not my father.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
T'CHALLA,"Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah?
STEVE ROGERS,You alright?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.  I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please."
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying you'll arrest me?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
STEVE ROGERS,"If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why?
STEVE ROGERS,Because I'm the one least likely to die trying.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Shit.
SAM WILSON,She tell you to stay out of it?  Might have a point.
STEVE ROGERS,He'd do it for me.
SAM WILSON,"1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me."
SHARON CARTER,"Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this.  My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get."
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.
SHARON CARTER,And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
HELMUT ZEMO,Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ( Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.)
GERMAN INNKEEPER,"Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ( Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.)"
HELMUT ZEMO,Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ( I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
GERMAN INNKEEPER,"Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ( Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)"
HELMUT ZEMO,"Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ( It's okay. This is wonderful.)"
GERMAN INNKEEPER,Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ( I'll put this on your . . .)
HELMUT ZEMO,"Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ( No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.)"
BUCKY BARNES,"( How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.)"
SAM WILSON,"Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south."
STEVE ROGERS,Understood.  Do you know me?
BUCKY BARNES,You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
SAM WILSON,They've set the perimeter.
STEVE ROGERS,I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
BUCKY BARNES,I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
SAM WILSON,They're entering the building.
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive."
BUCKY BARNES,That's smart. Good strategy.
SAM WILSON,They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
STEVE ROGERS,"This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck."
BUCKY BARNES,It always ends in a fight.
SAM WILSON,5 seconds.
STEVE ROGERS,You pulled me from the river. Why?
BUCKY BARNES,I don't know.
SAM WILSON,3 seconds!
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, you do."
SAM WILSON,Breach! Breach! Breach!
GSG-9 SOLDIER,Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!)
STEVE ROGERS,"Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone."
BUCKY BARNES,I'm not gonna kill anyone.
GSG-9 SOLDIER,Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ( Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
STEVE ROGERS,"Come on, man."
STEVE ROGERS,"Sam, southwest rooftop."
SAM WILSON,Who the hell's the other guy?
STEVE ROGERS,About to find out.
STEVE ROGERS,Sam.
SAM WILSON,Got him.
GSG-9 DRIVER,Stand down! Stand down!
STEVE ROGERS,"Sam, I can't shake this guy."
SAM WILSON,Right behind you.
JAMES RHODES,"Stand down, now.  Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal."
GSG-9 SOLDIER,Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
JAMES RHODES,Your highness.
VISION,'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that paprikash?
VISION,I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Spirits lifted.
VISION,"In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . ."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,May I?
VISION,Please. Wanda?
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Hmm.
VISION,"No one dislikes you, Wanda."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Thanks.
VISION,"Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you?
VISION,"My amygdala is synthetic, so . . ."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . .  I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees."
VISION,"Do you know, I don't know what this is?  Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you afraid of it?
VISION,"I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
VISION,"Alternatively, we could order a pizza?"
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Vision, are you not letting me leave?"
VISION,It is a question of safety.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I can protect myself.
VISION,Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,And what do you want?
VISION,For people to see you . . . as I do.
SAM WILSON,"So, you like cats?"
STEVE ROGERS,Sam.
SAM WILSON,What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
STEVE ROGERS,Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
T'CHALLA,"The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?"
STEVE ROGERS,What's gonna happen to him?
EVERETT ROSS,Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
SHARON CARTER,"This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander."
STEVE ROGERS,What about our lawyer?
EVERETT ROSS,"Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt."
SAM WILSON,I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.
EVERETT ROSS,"You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?"
T'CHALLA,I don't intend on going anywhere.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"For the record, this is what making things worse looks like."
STEVE ROGERS,He's alive.
TONY STARK,"No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Try not to break anything while we fix this.
TONY STARK,"Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir."
STEVE ROGERS,'Consequences'?
TONY STARK,Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not getting that shield back, am I?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too."
SAM WILSON,That's cold.
TONY STARK,Warmer than jail.
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
TONY STARK,"Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.  FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most."
STEVE ROGERS,Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
TONY STARK,"See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?"
STEVE ROGERS,Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
TONY STARK,"We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . ."
STEVE ROGERS,Pregnant?
TONY STARK,No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know."
TONY STARK,"A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.  In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work."
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single."
TONY STARK,"Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you."
STEVE ROGERS,I don't mean to make things difficult.
TONY STARK,"I know, because you're a very polite person."
STEVE ROGERS,If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
TONY STARK,"No, you don't."
STEVE ROGERS,"No, I don't. Sometimes . . ."
TONY STARK,"Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison."
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards."
TONY STARK,"Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . ."
STEVE ROGERS,Wanda? What about Wanda?
TONY STARK,"She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company."
STEVE ROGERS,"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . ."
TONY STARK,What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
STEVE ROGERS,"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony."
TONY STARK,She's not a US citizen.
STEVE ROGERS,"Oh, come on, Tony."
TONY STARK,And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
STEVE ROGERS,She's a kid!
TONY STARK,GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
STEVE ROGERS,You keep telling yourself that.  Hate to break up the set.
HELMUT ZEMO,"Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?"
SHARON CARTER,The receipt for your gear.
SAM WILSON,'Bird costume'? Come on.
SHARON CARTER,I didn't write it.
HELMUT ZEMO,"I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James."
BUCKY BARNES,My name is Bucky.
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,"Hallo? ( Hello?)  Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ( Hey. I have a big one for you.)  Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)"
CUSTODIAN,Hier? (Here?)
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,Ja. (Yeah.)
STEVE ROGERS,Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
SHARON CARTER,"Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?"
STEVE ROGERS,"Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier."
SHARON CARTER,You're saying someone framed him to find him.
SAM WILSON,"Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing."
STEVE ROGERS,We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
SHARON CARTER,"Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would."
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah.
HELMUT ZEMO,"Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?"
BUCKY BARNES,I don't want to talk about it.
HELMUT ZEMO,"You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry.  We only have to talk about one."
CUSTODIAN,"Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)"
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
EVERETT ROSS,"Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go."
TONY STARK,"FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage."
SHARON CARTER,"Sub-level 5, east wing."
BUCKY BARNES,What the hell is this?
HELMUT ZEMO,"Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home.  Желание. ( Longing.)"
BUCKY BARNES,No.
HELMUT ZEMO,Ржавый. ( Rusted.)
BUCKY BARNES,Stop.
HELMUT ZEMO,Семнадцать. ( Seventeen.)
BUCKY BARNES,Stop.
HELMUT ZEMO,Рассвет. ( Daybreak.)
HELMUT ZEMO,Печь. ( Furnace.) Девять. ( Nine.)
HELMUT ZEMO,Добросердечный. ( Benign.)
HELMUT ZEMO,Возвращение на Родину. ( Homecoming.) Один. ( One.) Грузовой вагон. ( Freight car.)
HELMUT ZEMO,Солдат? ( Soldier?)
BUCKY BARNES,Я готов отвечать. ( Ready to comply.)
HELMUT ZEMO,"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
HELMUT ZEMO,Help me. Help.
STEVE ROGERS,Get up.  Who are you? What do you want?
HELMUT ZEMO,To see an empire fall.
MAN ON PA #1,Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
SAM WILSON,Hey.
EVERETT ROSS,"Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Please tell me you brought a suit.
TONY STARK,"Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant."
SHARON CARTER,Follow me.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're in position.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could at least recognize me.
SAM WILSON,Damn it.
ZEMO'S WIFE,"He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you."
NEWS ANCHOR #5,"James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ( James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)"
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap!"
BUCKY BARNES,Steve.
STEVE ROGERS,Which Bucky am I talking to?
BUCKY BARNES,Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
STEVE ROGERS,Can't read that in a museum.
SAM WILSON,"Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?"
BUCKY BARNES,What did I do?
STEVE ROGERS,Enough.
BUCKY BARNES,"Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words."
STEVE ROGERS,Who was he?
BUCKY BARNES,I don't know.
STEVE ROGERS,"People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than ""I don't know."""
BUCKY BARNES,He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
STEVE ROGERS,Why would he need to know that?
BUCKY BARNES,Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
JOSEF / SUPER SOLDIER #1,It hurts!
,
VASILY KARPOV,"Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ( Good work.)"
VASILY KARPOV,"Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ( Get me out of here.)"
STEVE ROGERS,Who were they?
BUCKY BARNES,Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
SAM WILSON,They all turn out like you?
BUCKY BARNES,Worse.
STEVE ROGERS,"The doctor, could he control them?"
BUCKY BARNES,Enough.
STEVE ROGERS,Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
BUCKY BARNES,"With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming."
SAM WILSON,This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
STEVE ROGERS,If we call Tony . . .
SAM WILSON,"No, he won't believe us."
STEVE ROGERS,Even if he did . . .
SAM WILSON,Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
STEVE ROGERS,We're on our own.
SAM WILSON,Maybe not. I know a guy.
SECRETARY ROSS,I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
TONY STARK,We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
SECRETARY ROSS,"You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?"
SECRETARY ROSS,If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
TONY STARK,"All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in."
SECRETARY ROSS,How would that end any differently from the last time?
TONY STARK,"Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed."
SECRETARY ROSS,36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
TONY STARK,"Thank you, sir.  My left arm is numb, is that normal?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You alright?
TONY STARK,"Always.  36 hours, jeez."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're seriously understaffed.
TONY STARK,"Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF,No. You really think he'd be on our side?
TONY STARK,No.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I have an idea.
TONY STARK,Me too. Where's yours?
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Downstairs. Where's yours?
PETER PARKER,"Hey, May."
MAY PARKER,Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
PETER PARKER,Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . .
TONY STARK,"Oh, Mr. Parker."
PETER PARKER,"Um . . .  What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter."
TONY STARK,Tony.
PETER PARKER,What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
TONY STARK,"It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?"
PETER PARKER,Yeah. Yeah.
TONY STARK,Right?
PETER PARKER,Regarding the . . .
MAY PARKER,You didn't tell me about the grant.
PETER PARKER,About the grant.
TONY STARK,The September Foundation.
PETER PARKER,Right.
TONY STARK,Yeah. Remember when you applied?
PETER PARKER,Yeah.
TONY STARK,"I approved, so now we're in business."
MAY PARKER,You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
PETER PARKER,"Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?"
TONY STARK,That's what I'm here to hash out.
PETER PARKER,"Okay. Hash, hash out, okay."
TONY STARK,It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
MAY PARKER,"Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?"
TONY STARK,This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
PETER PARKER,Let me just stop you there.
TONY STARK,Yeah?
PETER PARKER,"Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?"
TONY STARK,Yeah.
PETER PARKER,Yeah?
TONY STARK,It's pretty well funded.
PETER PARKER,Wow.
TONY STARK,Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
MAY PARKER,Sure.
TONY STARK,"As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.  Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?"
PETER PARKER,"Uh, the garbage, actually."
TONY STARK,You're a dumpster diver.
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant."
TONY STARK,Ah-ah! Me first.
PETER PARKER,Okay.
TONY STARK,"Quick question of the rhetorical variety.  That's you, right?"
PETER PARKER,"Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?"
TONY STARK,"Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills."
PETER PARKER,"That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer."
TONY STARK,Mm-Hmm.
PETER PARKER,It's like that video. What is it?
TONY STARK,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?"
PETER PARKER,Exactly.
TONY STARK,"Oh, what have we here?"
PETER PARKER,Uh . . . that's a . . .
TONY STARK,So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
PETER PARKER,S . . . Spider-Man.
TONY STARK,"Not in that onesie, you're not."
PETER PARKER,"It's not a onesie.  I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!"
TONY STARK,Who else knows? Anybody?
PETER PARKER,Nobody.
TONY STARK,Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
PETER PARKER,"No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out."
TONY STARK,You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
PETER PARKER,I did.
TONY STARK,"Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?"
PETER PARKER,It's a long story. I was uh . . .
TONY STARK,Lordy! Can you even see in these?
PETER PARKER,"Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus."
TONY STARK,"You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.  Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?"
PETER PARKER,"Because . . .  because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months."
TONY STARK,Mm-Hmm.
PETER PARKER,"I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now."
TONY STARK,"Sure, because you're different."
PETER PARKER,"Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . .  and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you."
TONY STARK,"So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?"
PETER PARKER,Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
TONY STARK,"I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.  You got a passport?"
PETER PARKER,"Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license."
TONY STARK,You ever been to Germany?
PETER PARKER,No.
TONY STARK,"Oh, you'll love it."
PETER PARKER,I can't go to Germany!
TONY STARK,Why?
PETER PARKER,I got . . . homework.
TONY STARK,I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
PETER PARKER,I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
TONY STARK,Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
PETER PARKER,Don't tell Aunt May.
TONY STARK,"Alright, Spider-Man.  Get me out of this."
PETER PARKER,"Sorry, I'll get the . . ."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What is it?
VISION,"Stay here, please."
CLINT BARTON,Guess I shoulda knocked.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Oh my god! What are you doing here?
CLINT BARTON,Disappointing my kids.  I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
VISION,Clint!  You should not be here.
CLINT BARTON,"Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit."
VISION,Please consider the consequences of your actions.
CLINT BARTON,"Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go.  It's this way."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I've caused enough problems.
CLINT BARTON,"You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit.  I knew I should've stretched."
VISION,"Clint, you can't overpower me."
CLINT BARTON,I know I can't. But she can.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving."
VISION,I can't let you.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'm sorry.
VISION,If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I can't control their fear, only my own."
CLINT BARTON,Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
ATTACHE,"It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans."
SECURITY CHIEF,"Move, or you will be moved."
T'CHALLA,As entertaining as that would be . . .
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You really think you can find him?
T'CHALLA,My resources are considerable.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time."
T'CHALLA,You know where they are.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know someone who does.
SHARON CARTER,Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
STEVE ROGERS,It's low profile.
SHARON CARTER,"Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd."
BUCKY BARNES,Can you move your seat up?
SAM WILSON,No.
STEVE ROGERS,I owe you again.
SHARON CARTER,"Keeping a list.  You know, he kinda tried to kill me."
STEVE ROGERS,"Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you."
SHARON CARTER,I know.
STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you, Sharon."
SHARON CARTER,That was . . .
STEVE ROGERS,Late.
SHARON CARTER,Damn right. I should go.
STEVE ROGERS,Okay.
CLINT BARTON,Cap.
STEVE ROGERS,You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
CLINT BARTON,"Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt."
STEVE ROGERS,Thanks for having my back.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It was time to get off my ass.
STEVE ROGERS,How about our other recruit?
CLINT BARTON,"He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good."
SCOTT LANG,What timezone is this?
CLINT BARTON,Come on. Come on.
SCOTT LANG,Captain America.
STEVE ROGERS,Mr. Lang.
SCOTT LANG,"It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America.  I know you, too. You're great!  Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me.  Hey, man!"
SAM WILSON,"What's up, Tic Tac?"
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . ."
SAM WILSON,"It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again."
STEVE ROGERS,They tell you what we're up against?
SCOTT LANG,Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
STEVE ROGERS,"We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man."
SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, well, what else is new?"
BUCKY BARNES,We should get moving.
CLINT BARTON,We got a chopper lined up.
MAN ON PA #2,Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)
BUCKY BARNES,They're evacuating the airport.
SAM WILSON,Stark.
SCOTT LANG,Stark?
STEVE ROGERS,Suit up.
TONY STARK,"Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?"
JAMES RHODES,Definitely weird.
STEVE ROGERS,"Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this."
T'CHALLA,Captain.
STEVE ROGERS,Your highness.
TONY STARK,"Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?"
STEVE ROGERS,You're after the wrong guy.
TONY STARK,Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
STEVE ROGERS,"And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
TONY STARK,"All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!  Nice job, kid."
PETER PARKER,"Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you."
TONY STARK,"Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation."
PETER PARKER,"Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man."
TONY STARK,"Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . ."
PETER PARKER,"Hey, everyone."
TONY STARK,. . . Good job.
STEVE ROGERS,You've been busy.
TONY STARK,"And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart."
STEVE ROGERS,You did that when you signed.
TONY STARK,"Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite.  Come on."
SAM WILSON,"We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway."
STEVE ROGERS,"Alright, Lang."
PETER PARKER,"Hey, guys, something . . ."
JAMES RHODES,Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
SCOTT LANG,"I believe this is yours, Captain America."
TONY STARK,"Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?"
JAMES RHODES,"Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes."
T'CHALLA,Barnes is mine!
PETER PARKER,"Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?"
TONY STARK,What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
PETER PARKER,"Okay, copy that!"
T'CHALLA,"Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time."
SCOTT LANG,"Look, I really don't want to hurt you."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wouldn't stress about it.
BUCKY BARNES,What the hell is that?
SAM WILSON,Everyone's got a gimmick now.
PETER PARKER,"You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!  You have the right to remain silent!"
JAMES RHODES,"Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either."
TONY STARK,"Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings."
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You locked me in my room.
TONY STARK,"Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint."
CLINT BARTON,"Hey, man."
TONY STARK,"Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?"
CLINT BARTON,"Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss."
TONY STARK,First time for everything.
CLINT BARTON,Made you look.
FRIDAY,Multiple contusions detected.
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I detected that too."
PETER PARKER,"Oh god.  Hey buddy, I think you lost this!  Those wings carbon fiber?"
SAM WILSON,Is this stuff coming out of you?
PETER PARKER,"That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man."
SAM WILSON,I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
PETER PARKER,"Alright, sorry, my bad.  Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry.  Wwahhhh!"
BUCKY BARNES,You couldn't have done that earlier?
SAM WILSON,I hate you.
JAMES RHODES,Great.
SCOTT LANG,"Hey, Cap, heads up!  Throw it at this. Now!"
JAMES RHODES,"Oh, come on!"
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry."
JAMES RHODES,"Alright. Now, I'm pissed."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Is this, part of the plan?"
TONY STARK,"Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?"
CLINT BARTON,There's our ride.
STEVE ROGERS,Come on!
VISION,Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now.
SAM WILSON,"What do we do, Cap?"
STEVE ROGERS,We fight.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is gonna end well.
PETER PARKER,They're not stopping.
TONY STARK,Neither are we.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"We're still friends, right?"
CLINT BARTON,Depends on how hard you hit me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You were pulling your punches.
BUCKY BARNES,I didn't kill your father.
T'CHALLA,Then why did you run?
PETER PARKER,That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
STEVE ROGERS,Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
PETER PARKER,Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.  He also said to go for your legs.
SAM WILSON,"Clint, can you get him off me?"
CLINT BARTON,Buckled in?
SCOTT LANG,"Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go!"
STEVE ROGERS,Stark tell you anything else?
PETER PARKER,That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous.
STEVE ROGERS,"Guess he had a point.  You got heart, kid. Where're you from?"
PETER PARKER,Queens.
STEVE ROGERS,Brooklyn.
TONY STARK,Friday?
FRIDAY,We have some weapon systems offline.
TONY STARK,They what?
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop."
TONY STARK,Who's speaking?
SCOTT LANG,It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
TONY STARK,Friday?
FRIDAY,Deploying fire suppression system.
SCOTT LANG,Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa!
BUCKY BARNES,We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
STEVE ROGERS,We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
SAM WILSON,"No, you get to the jet! Both of you!  The rest of us aren't getting out of here."
CLINT BARTON,"As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it."
SAM WILSON,"This isn't the real fight, Steve."
STEVE ROGERS,"Alright, Sam, what's the play?"
SAM WILSON,"We need a diversion, something big."
SCOTT LANG,"I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me."
BUCKY BARNES,He's gonna tear himself in half?
STEVE ROGERS,"You're sure about this, Scott?"
SCOTT LANG,I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS!
PETER PARKER,Holy shit!
JAMES RHODES,"Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now."
STEVE ROGERS,I guess that's the signal.
SAM WILSON,"Way to go, Tic Tac!"
TONY STARK,Give me back my Rhodey.
PETER PARKER,I got him!
TONY STARK,"Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion."
SCOTT LANG,You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me.
CLINT BARTON,We haven't met yet.  I'm Clint.
T'CHALLA,I don't care.
JAMES RHODES,Ahhh!
SCOTT LANG,Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me!
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not gonna stop.
STEVE ROGERS,You know I can't.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm gonna regret this.  Go.
PETER PARKER,"Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?"
JAMES RHODES,"Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?"
TONY STARK,"I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side."
PETER PARKER,You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies?
TONY STARK,Maybe the kid's on to something.
JAMES RHODES,"High now, Tony. Go high."
PETER PARKER,YES! Ha ha! That was awesome!
SCOTT LANG,Does anyone have any orange slices?
TONY STARK,"Kid, you alright?"
PETER PARKER,Hey! Get off me!
TONY STARK,Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
PETER PARKER,"Oh. Hey, man."
TONY STARK,Yeah.
PETER PARKER,That was scary.
TONY STARK,Yeah. You're done. Alright?
PETER PARKER,What?
TONY STARK,You did a good job. Stay down.
PETER PARKER,"No, I'm good. I'm fine."
TONY STARK,Stay down.
PETER PARKER,"No, it's good I gotta get him back!"
TONY STARK,You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
PETER PARKER,"Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . .  Okay, I'm done. I'm done."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference."
VISION,I'm sorry.
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Me, too."
VISION,It's as I said. Catastrophe.
JAMES RHODES,"Vision, I got a bandit on my six.  Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider."
TONY STARK,Rhodey!
JAMES RHODES,"Tony, I'm flying dead stick."
TONY STARK,RHODES!  Read vitals.
FRIDAY,Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
SAM WILSON,I'm sorry.
GERMAN INNKEEPER,"Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)"
HELMUT ZEMO,"Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber.  This is room 201.)"
GERMAN INNKEEPER,"Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller.  Bacon and black coffee again today?)"
HELMUT ZEMO,Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ( You know me so well.)
GERMAN INNKEEPER,Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ( Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!)
BUCKY BARNES,What's gonna happen to your friends?
STEVE ROGERS,Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
BUCKY BARNES,"I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve."
STEVE ROGERS,What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
BUCKY BARNES,I know. But I did it.
TONY STARK,How did this happen?
VISION,I became distracted.
TONY STARK,I didn't think that was possible.
VISION,Neither did I.
TONY STARK,The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario."
TONY STARK,"You let them go, Nat."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We played this wrong.
TONY STARK,"'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
TONY STARK,"T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you."
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm not the one that needs to watch their back.
TONY STARK,"What am I looking at, Friday?"
FRIDAY,Priority upload from Berlin police.
TONY STARK,Fire up the chopper.
FRIDAY,The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
TONY STARK,Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY,What do I look like?
TONY STARK,"Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head."
FRIDAY,You must be thinking of someone else.
TONY STARK,Must be.
FRIDAY,"The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence.  Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad."
TONY STARK,"So, what happened to the real Broussard?"
FRIDAY,He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
TONY STARK,Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY,"Yes, Boss."
,
"INSIDE IS A VAST, GLOOMY SPACE CRAMPED WITH SHELVES STACKED WITH FILING BOXES. ZEMO MOVES A LADDER ALONG AND SEARCHES THE BOXES. HE CLIMBS UP THE LADDER AND REMOVES A FILING BOX LABELED",'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
,
GUARD,"This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark."
TONY STARK,"So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy."
SECRETARY ROSS,You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells.
CLINT BARTON,"The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not."
TONY STARK,"Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on."
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony."
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . ."
CLINT BARTON,"Criminals?  Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for.  Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are."
TONY STARK,Because you broke the law.
CLINT BARTON,Yeah.
TONY STARK,I didn't make you.
CLINT BARTON,"La, la, la, la, la . . ."
TONY STARK,"You read it, you broke it."
CLINT BARTON,"La, la, la, la la…"
TONY STARK,"Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side?"
CLINT BARTON,You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
SCOTT LANG,"Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark."
TONY STARK,Who are you?
SCOTT LANG,"Come on, man."
SAM WILSON,How's Rhodes?
TONY STARK,They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
SAM WILSON,You're the good cop now?
TONY STARK,I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
SAM WILSON,"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me."
TONY STARK,"Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment."
SECRETARY ROSS,What did you do? Get it back up!
TONY STARK,"Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong."
SAM WILSON,That's a first.
TONY STARK,Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
SAM WILSON,"Hey, it's alright.  Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend."
TONY STARK,Easy.
SECRETARY ROSS,Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
TONY STARK,"Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink."
,
,
,
STEVE ROGERS,You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
BUCKY BARNES,Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
STEVE ROGERS,You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
BUCKY BARNES,What was her name again?
STEVE ROGERS,Dolores. You called her Doll.
BUCKY BARNES,She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
STEVE ROGERS,"So are we, pal."
STEVE ROGERS,He can't have been here more than a few hours.
BUCKY BARNES,Long enough to wake them up.
STEVE ROGERS,You ready?
BUCKY BARNES,Yeah.
TONY STARK,You seem a little defensive.
STEVE ROGERS,It's been a long day.
TONY STARK,"At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you."
STEVE ROGERS,Then why are you here?
TONY STARK,"Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself."
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.  It's good to see you, Tony."
TONY STARK,"You too, Cap.  Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . ."
TONY STARK,I got heat signatures.
STEVE ROGERS,How many?
TONY STARK,"Uh, one."
HELMUT ZEMO,"If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.  Did you really think I wanted more of you?"
BUCKY BARNES,What the hell?
HELMUT ZEMO,"I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets."
TONY STARK,I'm betting I could beat that.
HELMUT ZEMO,"Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came."
STEVE ROGERS,You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?
HELMUT ZEMO,"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw."
STEVE ROGERS,You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
HELMUT ZEMO,Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
STEVE ROGERS,You lost someone?
HELMUT ZEMO,I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
TONY STARK,I know that road. What is this?
,
HOWARD STARK,Help my wife. Please. Help.
HOWARD STARK,Sergeant Barnes?
MARIA STARK,Howard!
MARIA STARK,Howard!
,
,
STEVE ROGERS,Tony. Tony.
TONY STARK,Did you know?
STEVE ROGERS,I didn't know it was him.
TONY STARK,"Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?"
STEVE ROGERS,Yes.
STEVE ROGERS,Get out of here!
STEVE ROGERS,"It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!"
TONY STARK,Move!
STEVE ROGERS,It wasn't him!
FRIDAY,Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
TONY STARK,Ah crap.
STEVE ROGERS,He's not going to stop. Go.
TONY STARK,"Come on, come on."
FRIDAY,"Targeting system's knackered, boss."
TONY STARK,I'm eyeballing it.  Do you even remember them?
BUCKY BARNES,I remember all of them.
STEVE ROGERS,This isn't gonna change what happened.
TONY STARK,I don't care. He killed my mom.
ZEMO'S WIFE,"You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you."
T'CHALLA,I almost kill the wrong man.
HELMUT ZEMO,Hardly an innocent one.
T'CHALLA,This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
HELMUT ZEMO,"My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, ""Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm."" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son."
T'CHALLA,Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them.  I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
HELMUT ZEMO,Tell that to the dead.
T'CHALLA,The living are not done with you yet.
FRIDAY,You can't beat him hand to hand.
TONY STARK,Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY,Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.
TONY STARK,Let's kick his ass.
STEVE ROGERS,He's my friend.
TONY STARK,So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.
STEVE ROGERS,I can do this all day.
TONY STARK,That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield!
EVERETT ROSS,"Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm?  So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?"
HELMUT ZEMO,Did it?
TONY STARK,It's just the first pass.
JAMES RHODES,Yeah.
TONY STARK,Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
JAMES RHODES,You may wanna think about some AC down in . . .
TONY STARK,Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
JAMES RHODES,"No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think."
TONY STARK,You okay?
JAMES RHODES,Oh yeah.
FEDEX DRIVER STAN LEE,"Are you Tony ""Stank""?"
JAMES RHODES,"Yes, this is--this is Tony ""Stank"". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. ""Stank"". Please, by the bathroom."
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . ."
FRIDAY,Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
TONY STARK,"Yeah, put him through."
SECRETARY ROSS,"Tony, we have a problem."
TONY STARK,"Ah, please hold."
SECRETARY ROSS,No. Don't . . .
STEVE ROGERS,"So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there."
STEVE ROGERS,You sure about this?
BUCKY BARNES,"I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody."
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you for this.
T'CHALLA,"Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…"
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him."
T'CHALLA,Let them try.
MAY PARKER,So. Who was it? Who hit you?
PETER PARKER,"Some guy. So itchy, man. God."
MAY PARKER,"What's ""some guy's"" name?"
PETER PARKER,"Uh, Steve."
MAY PARKER,Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
PETER PARKER,"No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.  Ouch."
MAY PARKER,Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge.  That's way better. Thank you."
MAY PARKER,"Okay, tough guy."
PETER PARKER,"Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?"
