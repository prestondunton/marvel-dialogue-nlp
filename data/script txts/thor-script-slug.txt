THOR

FADE IN:

On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn 
with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- 
a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind 
as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set 
amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves 
down the street and heads out of town.

EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels 
of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a 
variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point 
at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through 
the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor 
calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be 
cobbled together from spare parts of other devices.

JANE
Hurry!

We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. 
Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as 
well, rubbing his head.

JANE (CONT'D)
Oh-- watch your head.

SELVIG
Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"¬ù 
of yours supposed to look like?

JANE
It's a little different each time. 
Once it looked like, I don't know, 
melted stars, pooling in a corner 
of the sky. But last week it was a 
rolling rainbow ribbon--

SELVIG
(GENTLY TEASING)
"Racing "Àúround Orion?"¬ù I've 
always said you should have been a 
poet. Jane reigns in her 
excitement. She tries for dignity.

JANE
Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and 
my gloves, will you? 
(MORE)


Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane 
a bottle of Champagne and a pair of 
gloves through the window. Jane 
passes it to Selvig to hold while 
she pulls on the old gloves -- too 
large and masculine for her small 
hands. He starts to unwrap the 
foil, and she stops his hand with 
an excited grin.

JANE (CONT'D)
Not until you see it!

SELVIG
(re: the gloves)
I recognize those. Think how proud 
he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin 
fades to a sad smile.

JANE
Thank you.

SELVIG
For what?

JANE
The benefit of the doubt. The two 
stare out at the sky expectantly. A 
long beat while they scan the 
skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

JANE (CONT'D)
It's never taken this long before. 
Darcy calls up from the front seat.

DARCY (O.S.)
Can I turn on the radio?

JANE
(an edge to her voice)
Sure, if you like rocking out to 
KFRM, "All agriculture, all the 
time."¬ù

Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring 
equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held 
together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of 
handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the 
frustrated Jane with sympathy.

JANE (CONT'D)

2.


JANE
The anomalies are always 
precipitated by geomagnetic storms. 
She shows him a complicated CHART 
she's drawn in the book, tracking 
occurrences and patterns.

JANE (CONT'D)
The last seventeen occurrences have 
been predictable to the minute... I 
just don't understand. Something 
catches Darcy's eye out the 
driver's side mirror. She adjusts 
it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING 
CLOUDS form in the skies over the 
Northeastern end of the desert.

DARCY
Jane?

Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of 
champagne begins to vibrate.

JANE
There's got to be some new 
variable... Or an equipment 
malfunction...

The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around 
them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

DARCY
I don't think there's anything 
wrong with your equipment... The 
champagne bottle starts to RATTLE 
noisily now as it shakes more 
violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, 
when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing 
everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

DARCY (CONT'D)
Jane?

JANE
What?!

DARCY
I think you want to see this. Darcy 
points out the window. Jane and 
Selvig look out. Over the desert --

3.


MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT

Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

JANE
Holy. Shatner.

SELVIG
That's your "subtle"¬ù aurora?!

JANE
No-- yes! Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the 
strange event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half 
her body out the roof, taking video of the light storm 
before them. The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. 
Selvig grabs her, yanks her back in.

INT. SUV 5

Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

JANE
Isn't this great?! A thought 
strikes her.

JANE (CONT'D)
You're seeing it too, right? I'm 
not crazy?

SELVIG
That's debateable. Put your seat 
belt on!

The SUV lurches.

EXT. DESERT 6

Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from 
out of the clouds comes --

AN ENORMOUS TORNADO

Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a 
thousand freight trains as it touches down.

INT. SUV 7

Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the 
enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. 

4.


Jane clambers into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans 
way out the window, TAPING the storm.

JANE
You've gotta get us closer so I can 
take a magnetic reading. Darcy 
laughs.

DARCY
Yeah, right! Good one!
(then, realizing)
Oh God, you're serious...

JANE
You want those college credits or 
not?

EXT. SUV 8

The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane 
leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs 
two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds 
take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING 
strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before 
them with a terrifying intensity.

INT. SUV 9

The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns 
the wheel, starts to head away.

DARCY
Keep the credits. I'll intern at 
Burger King.

JANE
What are you doing?!

DARCY
Saving our lives! Jane grabs the 
wheel, jerks it hard the other way. 
They struggle for control, when the 
headlights fall on --

A MAN
Directly in their path, stumbling 
through the winds. Darcy slams on 
the brakes, Jane turns the wheel 
hard to avoid him. The SUV swerves -
- but too late.

5.


EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending 
him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

INT. SUV 11
11
11

Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard. 
They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through. A 
paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12
12
12

The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the 
man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing, 
charred and blackened.

DARCY
I think that was legally your 
fault.

JANE
Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads 
back inside the SUV as Jane, 
concerned, kneels next to the man. 
Selvig hovers, protectively. She 
gently turns his head to the light, 
and we see him clearly for the 
first time. He is magnificently 
handsome, long blonde hair flowing 
around his classically sculpted 
features. She cups her hands around 
his face, as if willing the life 
back into him.

JANE (CONT'D)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and 
don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes 
and look at me. Suddenly, he 
GROANS, and she's startled, then 
relieved, as his eyes flutter open. 
She looks deep into his confused, 
azure eyes, which at last focus on 
her own. Locking onto them.

For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is 
broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she 
sees how gorgeous the man is.

DARCY
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I 
know CPR.

6.


A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her 
heels. She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

JANE
HIS EYES--

DARCY
(DREAMILY)
--are beautiful.

JANE
--are dilating. That's a good sign.

SELVIG
We still have to get him to a 
hospital.

JANE
(HOPEFULLY)
After we get a reading on the 
storm?

SELVIG
Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and 
nods, regretfully watching the 
storm EVAPORATE above their heads. 
A thought strikes her.

JANE
Where did he come from? They 
exchange puzzled looks, as we move 
up through the last glowing 
remnants of the storm, and into:

EXT. SPACE 13
13
13

EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and 
resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
Questions, they've always asked 
questions -- this race called man, 
on this planet they call earth. 
Passionately longing to know how 
they are connected to the heavens.

We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, 
cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our 
galaxy.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
In ages past, they looked to us as 
gods, for indeed so many times we 
saved them from calamity. 
(MORE)

7.


We tried to show them how their 
world was but one of the Nine 
Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all 
others by the branches of 
Yggdrasil... We pull back until we 
see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, 
sprawling, like a quasar or a 
nebula twisted into the vague shape 
of a TREE, its branches of glowing 
energy stretching out into the 
black void of space.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in 
a universe of wonder, beauty, and 
terror that they barely 
comprehended.

We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like 
a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
But for all their thirst for 
knowledge, they let our lessons 
fall into myth and dreams. Where 
did he come from? He came from us, 
the proudest race of warriors the 
Worlds have ever seen. He came from 
this -- the greatest Realm the 
universe has ever known. We move 
through the galaxy's mists and 
astral matter, then over and up, 
through a band of prismatic color 
to reveal what's on the other side:

HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He came... from Asgard!

EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent 
landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, 
modern yet timeless.

EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an 
other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm 
sprawled out before it. We move towards a large window of 
the palace, where a FIGURE

HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

STANDS --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Stares out at his kingdom. The 
ravens fly up to the balcony, land 
at his side.

INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

16

Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a 
vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

ODIN
Do you think he's ready?

FRIGGA
He thinks he is. He has his 
father's confidence.

ODIN
He'll need his father's wisdom.

FRIGGA
And his humility? Odin reacts.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Thor won't be alone. Loki will be 
at his side to give him counsel. 
Have faith in your sons.

ODIN
Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He 
could be a great King... Odin 
stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It 
seems to be out of synch temporally 
with the rest of the world, leaving 
a trail as it moves. He stares at 
it determinedly, concentrating, 
trying to stop the strange event 
through the force of his sheer 
will.

Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. 
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(QUIETLY)
...if we only had more time.

FRIGGA
For once, our son needs something 
we cannot provide.

9.


ODIN
I can fight it a little longer...

FRIGGA
No. You've put it off too long! I 
worry for you.

He touches her cheek.

ODIN
I've destroyed demons and monsters, 
devastated whole worlds, laid waste 
to mighty kingdoms, and still you 
worry for me?

FRIGGA
Always.

ODIN
Not today. Now come kiss your 
king... while I'm still king. He 
pulls her close, and they kiss.

INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

17

Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners 
hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of 
the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge 
figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks 
forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of 
the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a 
raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of 
wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire 
directly below.

THOR
Another!

The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow 
intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full 
length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds 
down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We 
follow from behind and see at the other end, massively 
shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great 
horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, 
from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his 
horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great 
ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that 
lead up to the crowded throne room.

LOKI

(TO THOR)
Nervous, brother?

10.


THOR
Have you ever known me to be 
nervous?

LOKI
There was the time in Nornheim...

THOR
That wasn't nerves, brother. It was 
the rage of battle. How else could 
I have fought my way through a 
hundred warriors and pulled us out 
alive?

The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for 
Thor.

LOKI
As I recall, I was the one who 
veiled us in smoke to ease our 
escape.

THOR
Some do battle, others just do 
tricks.

The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like 
it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. 
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and 
across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the 
goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

THOR (CONT'D)
Loki...

Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn 
back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

THOR (CONT'D)
Now that was just a waste of good 
wine.

LOKI
Just a bit of fun.
(to the Attendant)
Right, my friend? The Attendant 
isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-
WINGED

HELMET.

LOKI
(re: Thor's helmet)
Nice feathers.

11.


THOR
You don't really want to start this 
again, do you, Cow?

LOKI
I was being sincere!

THOR
You're incapable of sincerity.

LOKI
Am I?

He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

LOKI (CONT'D)
I've looked forward to this day as 
long as you have. You're my brother 
and my friend. Sometimes I'm 
envious, but never doubt that I 
love you.

Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. 
He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very 
good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his 
brother's shoulder.

THOR
Thank you.

The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

LOKI
Give us a kiss.

THOR
Stop.

Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

THOR (CONT'D)
How do I look?

LOKI
Like a king.

They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

LOKI (CONT'D)
It's time.

THOR
You go ahead.

12.


Loki casts him a wary look.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads 
inside the palace without his 
brother.

INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big 
event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE 
stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then 
eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL 
checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his 
moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN 
holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on 
dreamily.

FANDRAL
Thank you, love.
(to the Maidens)

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Now who'd like to polish my sword 
for me?

The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands 
staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, 
amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the 
ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL 
ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. 
Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the 
Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN 
CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, 
then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet 
intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking 
radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table.

SIF
(to the weapons)
I'll miss you.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the 
room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across 
Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement. Thor's COMRADES 
enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the 
hall. They are:

THE WARRIORS THREE

VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with 
oversized passions to match. 

13.


FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, 
and nattily dressed. HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a 
large MACE slung at his side. With them walks the warrior 
maiden SIF. She's clad in armor, a shield and sword at her 
side -- a beauty not to be trifled with.

VOLSTAGG
I hope this goes quickly. I'm 
famished.

FANDRAL
(FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
Noooo!

VOLSTAGG
Are you attached to that pretty 
face of yours? Because one more 
word, and you won't be.

FANDRAL
(to the others)
My, we are hungry, aren't we? The 
others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral 
turns to him.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. 
Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one 
smile.

Hogun stares at him grimly.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
All right, half a smile. Look, 
forget the smile, just show some 
teeth.

SIF
Fandral, is it true the famous 
Warriors Three are ready to meet 
any challenge?

FANDRAL
Name it, Lady Sif.

SIF
Keep your mouth shut.

Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the

beneath the palace. A cold BREEZE blows past them.

Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of 
his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

FRIGGA
It's all right to be nervous.

THOR
Why does everyone keep saying that? 
I'm not nervous!

FRIGGA
You may be able to fool the rest of

ASGARD --

THOR
...but never you. I know.

FRIGGA
Thor, just remember that you have 
something even the great Allfather 
never had.

THOR
And what is that?

FRIGGA
Me for a mother. She smiles.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Now don't keep your father waiting. 
Frigga leaves.

Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki 
and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the 
hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, 
the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves 
into formation. They part to reveal --

ODIN
Sitting atop his throne, clad in 
full ceremonial armor. He holds his 
spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace 
of weakness in him is gone now. He 
exudes all the power and majesty of 
a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him 
at his side. He looks around the 
hall, casts a glance over to the 
Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be 
seen. Odin looks to Loki. 
(MORE)

15.


Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A 
murmur spreads through the crowd.

VOLSTAGG
(sotto, to Loki)
Where is he?

LOKI
He said he'd be along. Sif realizes 
the truth, shakes her head in 
disapproval.

VOLSTAGG
What?

SIF
He wants to make an entrance.

FANDRAL
Well, if he doesn't show up soon, 
he shouldn't bother. Odin looks 
like he's ready to feed him to his 
ravens.

LOKI
I wouldn't worry. Father will 
forgive him. He always does.

Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the 
lower level --

MJOLNIR
Roars up into the hall, Thor 
strides cockily into the hall 
behind it, catching it behind his 
back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. 
Thor spins his hammer with a 
flourish, holds it up before the 
crowd, basking in the moment, 
relishing the adoration, whipping 
his audience up into a frenzy.

SIF
Oh, please.

Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

INT. VAULT - DAY 21

As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold 
breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to 
warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing 
something's not right. 

ODIN (CONT'D)

16.


They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's 
hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a 
pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look 
up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front 
of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and 
father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks 
up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir 
upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls 
silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He 
raises Gungnir before him.

ODIN
Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power 
strong. With it I have defended 
Asgard and the lives of the 
innocent across the Nine Realms 
since the time of the Great 
Beginning. And though the day has 
come for a new King to wield his 
own weapon -- that duty remains the 
same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my 
first-born.

ODIN (CONT'D)
So long entrusted with this mighty 
hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the 
heart of a dying star, from the 
sacred metal of Uru. Only one may 
lift it. Only one is worthy. Who 
wields this hammer commands the 
lightning and the storm. Its power 
has no equal -- as a weapon, to 
destroy, or as a tool, to build. It 
is a fit companion for a King.

INT. VAULT - DAY 23

23

The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now 
strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just 
catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large 
and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off 
its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate 
latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and 
retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind 
it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind 
them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

The Ceremony continues.

17.


ODIN
Today I entrust you with the 
greatest honor in all the Nine 
Realms. The sacred throne of 
Asgard. I have sacrificed much to 
achieve peace. So, too, must a new 
generation sacrifice to maintain 
that peace. Responsibility, duty, 
honor. These are not merely virtues 
to which we must aspire. They are 
essential to every soldier and to 
every King. The Crowd and the 
Warriors Three start to shiver and 
rub their limbs for warmth in the 
increasingly cold air of the hall.

Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son 
with pride.

ODIN (CONT'D)
Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard 
the Nine Realms?

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Do you swear to preserve the peace?

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Do you swear to cast aside all 
selfish ambition and pledge 
yourself only to the good of all 
the Realms?

Beat.

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Then on this day, I, Odin 
Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin 
hesitates, noticing a strange sight 
before him. ICE creeps across the 
surface of the large banners around 
the hall, making an eerie CRACKING 
sound. Thor, his comrades, and the 
crowd see it too.

Frost giants...

The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the

Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him. 
Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and 
stop short. Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the 
floor. We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost 
Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and 
smoldering remains on the floor. They've just lost a savage 
battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the 
black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it. It 
is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

SIF
The Destroyer.

VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
I thought it was but a legend. Odin 
steps in behind the Asgardians, as 
the Destroyer sets the Casket back 
on its pedestal. It moves back to 
its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW 
extinguishes within it. Fandral 
looks around the Vault, ill at 
ease.

FANDRAL
I've never been inside the Vault 
before. It's said the Tesseract was 
once held here.

VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
The Tesseract? I thought that was 
but a legend too!

SIF
Shush!

Odin surveys the destruction.

19.


THOR
The Jotuns must pay for what 
they've done!

ODIN
They have paid with their lives. 
The Destroyer did its job, and the 
Casket is safe. All is well.

THOR
"All is well?!"¬ù They broke into 
the Weapons Vault! If the Frost 
Giants had stolen even one of these

RELICS--

ODIN
But they didn't.

THOR
I want to know why they--

ODIN
(INTERRUPTING)
The Casket of Ancient Winters 
belonged to the Jotuns. They 
believe it's their birthright.

THOR
And if you hadn't taken it from 
them they would have laid waste to 
all the Nine Realms!

ODIN
I have a truce with Laufey, the 
Jotun King.

THOR
He just broke your truce! We must 
act!

Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

ODIN
Leave us.

Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

ODIN (CONT'D)
And what action would you take?

20.


THOR
March into Jotunheim as you once 
did, teach them a lesson, break 
their spirits so they'll never dare 
try to cross our borders again!

ODIN
You're thinking only as a warrior!

THOR
This was an act of war!

ODIN
It was the act of but a few, doomed 
to fail.

THOR
They got this far!

ODIN
We will find the breach in our 
defenses. It will be found, and it 
will be sealed.

THOR
As King of Asgard, I would--

ODIN
You are not King. Not yet. Thor 
sees in his father's face that he's 
pushed this as far as he can. He 
backs away, then leaves, pushing 
through the doors so hard that they 
SLAM backwards behind him. Odin 
watches him go.

INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26
26
26

Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the 
festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger 
and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the 
massive tables. From across the room, Loki watches him.

AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE

Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in 
search of his dinner.

SIF
Redecorating, are we? Volstagg 
surveys the overturned tables and 
food, aghast.

21.


VOLSTAGG
What's this -- ?!

HOGUN
I told you they'd cancel it.

FANDRAL
We thought that was just you being 
your normal cheery self. Volstagg 
looks about the floor, despairing.

VOLSTAGG
All this food -- so innocent, cast 
to the ground. It breaks the heart!

Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki 
calmly moves towards him.

THOR
It's unwise to be in my company 
right now, brother.

LOKI
Who said I was wise?

THOR
(re: the empty hall)
This was to be my day of triumph.

LOKI
It will come. In time.

(ADMITS)
If it's any consolation, I think 
you're right. About the Frost 
Giants, about Laufey, everything. 
If a few of them could penetrate 
the defenses of Asgard once, who's 
to say they won't try again. Next 
time with an army?

THOR
Yes, exactly!

LOKI
But there's nothing we can do 
without defying Father. Thor 
considers this, looks at his 
hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki 
can guess what he's thinking, grows 
concerned.

LOKI (CONT'D)
No... stop there! I know that look!

22.


THOR
It's the only way to ensure the 
safety of our borders.

LOKI
It's madness!

VOLSTAGG
Madness? What sort of madness?

LOKI
Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

THOR
The safety of our Realm is no jest. 
We're going to Jotunheim.

FANDRAL
What?!

SIF
Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, 
this is one you must not break. 
Loki looks on, intrigued by the 
proceedings.

FANDRAL
This isn't like a journey to Earth, 
where you summon a little lightning 
and thunder and the mortals worship 
you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

VOLSTAGG
And if the Frost Giants don't kill 
you, your Father will!

THOR
My father fought his way into 
Jotunheim, defeated their armies, 
and took their Casket! We'd just be 
looking for answers.

SIF
It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his 
friends, smiles. He proceeds to 
make his case with enthusiasm and 
charismatic conviction.

THOR
My friends, have you forgotten all 
that we've done together? He turns 
to Fandral.

23.


THOR (CONT'D)
Who brought you into the sweet 
embrace of the most exotic maidens 
in all of Yggdrasil?

FANDRAL
You did.

THOR
(TO HOGUN)
Who led you into the most glorious 
of battles...

(TO VOLSTAGG)
...and to delicacies so succulent, 
you thought you'd died and gone to 
Valhalla?

VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
You did. / You did. He turns to 
Sif.

THOR
And who proved wrong all who 
scoffed at the idea that a young 
maiden could be one of the fiercest 
warriors this Realm has ever known?

SIF
I did.

THOR
(QUICKLY)
True. But I supported you...
(then, to the others)
My friends, trust me now. We must 
do this.

The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no 
convincing him.

THOR (CONT'D)
Come on. You're not going to let my 
brother and me take all the glory, 
are you?

Loki looks startled.

LOKI
What?

THOR
You are coming with me...

24.


LOKI
Yes, of course! I won't let my 
brother march into Jotunheim alone. 
I will be at his side.

VOLSTAGG
And I.

FANDRAL
And I.

HOGUN
And I. The Warriors Three fight 
together.

SIF
I fear we'll live to regret this.

VOLSTAGG
If we're lucky.

EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27
27
27

Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the 
Palace, across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS 
who ready their battle gear for their journey. Loki slips 
away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD. Hogun 
notices.

THOR
We must first find a way to get 
past Heimdall.

VOLSTAGG
That will be no easy task. It's 
said the Gatekeeper can see a 
single dew drop fall from a blade 
of grass a thousand worlds away.

FANDRAL
And he can hear a cricket passing 
gas in Niffelheim.

VOLSTAGG
Jest not! He heareth all!

FANDRAL
Please. Getting past him should be 
simple enough now, since he seems 
to be letting Frost Giants sneak by 
under his nose.

Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

25.


VOLSTAGG
Forgive him! He meaneth no offense!

Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28
28
28

Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through 
the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the 
most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to 
the mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance 
far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches 
Heimdall's Observatory.

EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29
29
29

The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, 
Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge 
before them, blocking their way, staring them down. There is 
something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm. He 
holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, 
intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something 
glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

LOKI
Keep your weapons sheathed and your 
mouths closed. This is going to 
take subtlety and sincerity, not 
brute strength. Leave it to me. 
Loki dismounts and steps forward.

LOKI (CONT'D)
GOOD HEIMDALL--

HEIMDALL
You're not dressed warmly enough. 
Thor, Loki, and the others trade 
looks.

LOKI
I'm sorry?

HEIMDALL
The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It 
will kill you all in time, even 
Thor.

(THEN)
You think you can deceive me? I, 
who watch all? 
(MORE)

26.


I, who can sense the flapping of a 
butterfly's wings a thousand worlds 
away? He fixes his eyes pointedly 
at Fandral.

HEIMDALL
Or can hear a cricket passing gas 
in Niffelheim?

Fandral looks gob-smacked.

FANDRAL
That was just a bit of a jest, 
really...

Loki goes into damage control.

LOKI
You must be mistaken. We're not--

THOR
(STEPPING FORWARD)
Enough.

(TO HEIMDALL)
Heimdall, may we pass? Heimdall 
stares him down.

HEIMDALL
For ages have I guarded Asgard and 
kept it safe from those who would 
do it harm. In all that time, never 
has an enemy slipped by my watch -- 
until this day. I wish to know how 
that happened.

THOR
Then tell no one where we've gone 
until we've returned. Thor walks 
past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper 
lets the group pass. Volstagg walks 
beside the frustrated Loki, needles 
him.

VOLSTAGG
What happened? Your silver tongue 
turn to lead?

LOKI
Get me off this bridge before it 
cracks under your girth. Volstagg 
and Fandral share a laugh.

(THEN) (CONT'D)

27.


INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30
30
30

Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a 
platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus 
at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

HEIMDALL
Be warned. I will honor my sworn 
oath to protect this Realm as its 
Gatekeeper. If your return 
threatens the safety of Asgard, 
Bifrost will remain closed to you. 
You'll be left to die in the cold 
wastes of Jotunheim.

THOR
I have no plans to die today.

HEIMDALL
None do.

Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the 
apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31
31
31

The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into 
the Observatory.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32
32
32

Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The 
Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a 
section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his 
sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, 
the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The 
Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and 
his five comrades stand.

HEIMDALL
All is ready. You may pass.

VOLSTAGG
Couldn't you just leave the bridge 
open for us?

HEIMDALL
To keep this bridge open would 
unleash the full power of the 
Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with 
you upon it.

28.


VOLSTAGG
Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts 
towards the Bifrost, turns back to 
the others, grins.

THOR
Come on. Don't be bashful. The 
others join him at his side, then 
step towards the Bifrost. Their 
bodies stretch towards the 
maelstrom, changing shape, as if 
every atom of their being is being 
elongated by the pull of it. In an 
instant, they're jerked off the 
platform and inside the vortex.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33
33
33

A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting 
out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor 
and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are 
imprinted on the ice around them.

Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly 
grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling 
precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's 
inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

THOR
Come on, big fella. Up...! With an 
effort, Thor pulls the burly 
warrior back onto the ice and, 
tremendously relieved, he 
proclaims:

VOLSTAGG
This belt! This belt is now my 
lucky belt! I will never remove it! 
Even when bathing!

FANDRAL
You bathe?

Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder 
at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet 
is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking 
apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges 
and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks 
and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun 
city lies in the distance.

HOGUN
We shouldn't be here.

29.


THOR
Too late now.

FANDRAL
Actually, it's not. We could turn 
right around, hop back to Asgard, 
share a mug by the fire. Could be 
nice.

Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

LOKI
Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns 
back to his brother.

THOR
For what?

LOKI
To survey the enemy. To gauge their 
strengths and weaknesses from a 
distance.

VOLSTAGG
I'm liking that. Gauging, 
surveying. Particularly the 
distance part.

THOR
We know all we must. It's time to 
act.

Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

SIF
He's just got to swing his 
hammer...

EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34
34
34

The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, 
shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki 
looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, 
invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

THOR
It feels good, doesn't it? To be 
together again, adventuring on 
another world?

FANDRAL
Adventuring? Is that what we're 
doing?

30.


THOR
What would you call it?

FANDRAL
Freezing.

VOLSTAGG
Starving.

SIF
Whining.

THOR
How about a song to lift our 
spirits?

The others groan.

HOGUN
No, not that!

SIF
Please don't make us sing again!

FANDRAL
If I have to listen to Volstagg's 
singing voice one more time, I'll 
fall on my own sword!

SIF
Well, now I'm on board. She and 
Thor share a grin. The party 
reaches the edge of the city -- its 
ancient structures of jade and ice 
melting and crumbling, ravaged by 
warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies 
before them, across a central 
plaza.

SIF (CONT'D)
Where are they?

THOR
Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor 
leads the others onwards towards 
the central plaza. Loki reluctantly 
follows. They don't notice as 
SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows 
of the structures nearby.

EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35
35
35

The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in 
the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides. 

31.


The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons. A JOTUN 
SENTRY calls to him.

JOTUN SENTRY
What is your business here, 
Asgardian?

The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

THOR
I speak only to your King. Not to 
his foot soldiers.

JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
Then speak.

Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, 
where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading 
waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too 
proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and 
his people have endured.

LAUFEY
I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

THOR
And I am--

LAUFEY
We know who you are, Odinson. Why 
have you brought the stench of your 
blood into my world?

THOR
I demand answers. Laufey stands, 
sizing up Thor, tries to piece this 
together.

LAUFEY
You "demand?"¬ù

THOR
How did your people get into 
Asgard?

LAUFEY
The house of Odin is full of 
traitors.

Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, 
disturbed by the Jotun King's words.

32.


THOR
Do not dishonor my father's name 
with your lies.

LAUFEY
Your father is a murderer and a 
thief. He stole what was ours, and 
left our world in ruins. We have 
the right to reclaim the Casket.

THOR
Not when you'd use it to make war 
against other Realms. Laufey 
laughs, cold, mocking.

LAUFEY
And why have you come here? To make 
peace? You long for battle. You 
crave it. I see you for what you 
are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a 
boy, trying to prove himself a man.

THOR
This boy has grown tired of your 
mockery.

Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in 
front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost 
Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet 
tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores 
him.

LOKI
Thor, stop and think. Look around 
you. We are outnumbered.

THOR
Know your place, brother...

LAUFEY
You should listen to his counsel. 
You know not what your actions 
would unleash.

Laufey steps out of the shadows.

LAUFEY (CONT'D)
But I do. Go now, while I still 
allow it.

Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

33.


LOKI
We will accept your most gracious 
offer.

The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down 
a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades 
breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant 
nearby mutters under his breath.

JOTUN
Run back home, little princess. 
Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes 
white. He knows what's coming.

LOKI
Damn.

In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS 
the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly 
draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. 
Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

VOLSTAGG
Silly hammer! Has a mind of its 
own!

ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR 
around them, extending off the ends of their arms like 
SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

FANDRAL
I'm hoping that's just decorative. 
Thor leaves the circle of 
Asgardians, swings at another Frost 
Giant. His comrades form another 
circle around him, separating him 
from the Jotuns, as he whirls his 
hammer around once and catches it 
with a cocky grin. He's enjoying 
this.

THOR
Next!

Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

FANDRAL
Well? What move, do you think?

VOLSTAGG
I say we use "The Norn's 
Revenge."¬ù

34.


FANDRAL
At this close range? I think "The 
Alfheim Lunge"¬ù is a better move.

VOLSTAGG
(DISGUSTED)
Maybe if they were three feet tall! 
No! How about "The Randy 
Valkyrie"¬ù?

HOGUN
Shut up!

Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks 
loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun 
backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an 
ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over 
his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself 
up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him. Hogun 
takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, 
dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with 
his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another 
with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to 
the ground.

SIF
If you don't treat me like a lady, 
I won't act like a lady! She takes 
out the Jotun. Loki backs away from 
an approaching Jotun, finds himself 
at the edge of a deep crevasse. The 
Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes 
at him. But the Jotun's arm passes 
right through him. The Giant stands 
there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI 
comes out from behind a structure 
and shoves the Giant into the 
crevasse below. The false Loki 
dissipates into nothingness.

LOKI
(to the falling Giant)
Pathetic.

He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from 
either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at 
once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun 
BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself 
up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his 
feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to 
explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior 
flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some 
Jotuns.

35.


THOR
Come on! At least make it a 
challenge for me! He sees the Brute 
coming at him. The huge Jotun lands 
a tremendous blow, sending Thor 
back across the ice. Thor rises, 
grins.

THOR (CONT'D)
Now that's more like it! He throws 
Mjolnir with all his strength, 
knocking the Brute head over heels. 
Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows 
in mid-air, then flies back to his 
grasp.

THOR (CONT'D)
(re: the fallen Brute)
Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a 
couple Frost Giants, but she's 
knocked to the ground by another. 
It raises its weapon above her. 
Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls 
a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and 
hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting 
him square in the chest. The Jotun 
falls dead.

SIF
(to Hogun, re: knife)
I'm so glad I taught him how to do 
that!

Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good 
hits in.

VOLSTAGG
You may want to put some ice on 
that!

The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in 
a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. 
Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
You may be taller, but I'm wider! 
Volstagg launches his mighty belly 
at the Jotun and sends him flying.

Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and 
sending him crashing to the ground.

36.


VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
It's not too late for you to 
surrender.

Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's 
bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the 
Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing 
Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's 
ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes 
a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his 
breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret 
compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small 
FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. 
He yells to his comrades.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Don't let them grab hold of you! He 
takes a swig, enjoying the brief 
respite, then rejoins the battle.

Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword 
stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow 
to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif 
sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one 
quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using 
her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's 
chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the 
ground.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
(on his belly)
Thank you, my lady. But I nearly 
had him!

SIF
Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost 
Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE 
BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif 
raises her shield barely in time, 
as the bullets go pinging and 
ricocheting off it. She races into 
the group of Frost Giants who 
attacked her and takes them out.

A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- 
FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, 
hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.

VOLSTAGG
Hang on!

37.


Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around 
Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly 
worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously 
close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

HOGUN
Watch the legs!

VOLSTAGG
(REALIZING)
Right. Sorry.

Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally 
freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost 
Giant.

FANDRAL
You really think your icicles are a 
match for Asgardian steel? Fandral 
lunges at the Giant. The Jotun 
knocks his blade away.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Fair enough.

Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's 
sword and snaps it in half.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Could we stop just a moment while I 
get another sword? Fandral fights 
the Giant with his broken sword. 
The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, 
who ducks just in time, grabs hold 
of the Giant's sword and redirects 
it, stabbing the Giant through with 
his own weapon. The Jotun staggers 
back, then reaches down and swipes 
at a pool of water, sending up a 
spray that freezes in mid-air, 
forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It 
impales Fandral, rendering him 
helpless.

Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and 
felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- 
unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights 
them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the 
impaled Fandral.

VOLSTAGG
That's unfortunate. He hurries to 
his wounded comrade.

38.


FANDRAL
I may need a bit of help. Not a 
good look, is it?

VOLSTAGG
Just try not to bleed.

FANDRAL
How's the face?

VOLSTAGG
Flawless.

Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice 
stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one 
of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved 
wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are 
still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. 
The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare 
arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But 
instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm 
turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness 
spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. 
The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the 
unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the 
distraction, KICKS the Giant.

Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts 
the Jotuns around him.

THOR
Come on!

But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost 
Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor 
from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. 
Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately 
struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now 
free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings 
him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From 
his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's 
time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the 
palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the 
wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The 
Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.

LOKI
That can't be good.

VOLSTAGG
Yes, it could! Might be an early 
spring!

39.


They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see 
shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN 
WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the 
battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of 
the Giants.

LOKI
Thor, we must go! Thor, still 
without his hammer, fights his 
Jotun foes mercilessly, a man 
consumed by blood lust. Loki sees 
the look on his brother's face -- 
the savage thrill of the heat of 
battle.

THOR
Then go!

SIF
There are too many of them!

THOR
I can stop them! The others 
hesitate. Jotuns break up through 
the ice all around them.

SIF
Thor!

But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

VOLSTAGG
Run!

Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of 
the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give 
chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of 
them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he 
disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

MOMENT --

THOR'S FIST
Forces its way up through the 
middle of the pile of Jotuns. He 
opens his hand, beckoning. One of 
Thor's attackers hears something 
ROARING up behind him. He whirls 
around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him 
square in the face, then flies into 
Thor's outstretched hand. Thor 
raises the hammer up high, and 
brings it down on the ground with 
all his might. KRAKABOOM! 
(MORE)

40.


Lightning strikes down from the 
sky, the hammer channeling the 
blast, firing the electricity out 
at the Jotuns around him. They're 
blasted back in a massive 
shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, 
drop dead to the ground.

But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the 
shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to 
where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground 
beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

VOLSTAGG
What's Thor done?

LOKI
Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns 
race towards the Asgardians, they 
open their mouths wide and breathe 
out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists 
quickly engulf the fleeing 
Asgardians before them. The 
Asgardians stand in the mist, 
unable to see. Hogun takes a step 
back, the ice cracking beneath him. 
They dare not move, for fear of 
falling through, into the void 
below. Thor sees he's put his 
friends in even greater danger. He 
raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE 
WINDS. They lift him off the ground 
and carry him across the frozen 
wasteland to his comrades.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

THOR
Loki, we have to see. Loki raises 
his arms, concentrates, the mists 
dissipating. But as they do, the 
Asgardians see before them the 
faces of the Frost Giants. And 
there are HUNDREDS of them -- too 
many, even for a Thunder God.

VOLSTAGG
(TO LOKI)
Actually, could you bring the mists 
back, please?

THOR'S FIST (CONT'D)

41.


Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead. 
The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening 
ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts 
down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom 
comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of 
all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Astride his powerful, eight-legged 
steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle 
armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an 
imposing sight.

The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, 
stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his 
fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises 
him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking 
it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with 
Odin. Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure 
what's about to happen. Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that 
as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken 
their toll. He's not the foe he once was. The two rulers 
talk quietly, out of earshot of the others.

ODIN
Laufey. End this.

LAUFEY
Your boy sought this out.

ODIN
You're right. These are the actions 
of a boy. Treat them as such. You 
and I can stop this before there's 
further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin 
and the others, Laufey starts to 
form an ice blade at the end of his 
arm.

LAUFEY
We are beyond diplomacy now, 
Allfather. He'll get what he came 
for -- war and death. Odin looks 
grim, determined.

ODIN
So be it.

Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but 
Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon 
the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards 
in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other 
Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing 
Jotuns with delight.

42.


THOR
Now! We'll finish them together!

ODIN
Silence!

Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the 
Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops 
the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the 
hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. 
Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls 
Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to 
him. Heimdall backs away.

THOR
Why did you bring us back?

ODIN
Do you realize what you've done? 
What you've started?

THOR
I was protecting my home.

ODIN
You cannot protect your friends. 
How can you hope to protect a 
kingdom?

Odin turns to the others.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(RE: FANDRAL)
Get him to the healing room! Sif, 
Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help 
Fandral out of the room.

THOR
There won't be a kingdom to protect 
if you're afraid to act! Odin 
stares at him.

THOR (CONT'D)
Whatever the cost, the world must 
know that the new King of Asgard 
will not be held in contempt.

ODIN
That's pride and vanity that talks! 
Not leadership! 
(MORE)

43.


Have you forgotten everything I've 
taught you? What of a warrior's 
patience, cunning?

THOR
While you wait and be patient, the 
Nine Realms laugh at us! The old 
ways are done. You'd stand giving 
speeches while Asgard falls!

ODIN
You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

THOR
And you are an old man and a fool! 
The whole world seems to stop at 
Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. 
When he speaks again, there's 
something terrifying beneath the 
calmness of his words.

ODIN
A fool, yes! I was a fool to think 
you were ready.

Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

LOKI
FATHER--

Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his 
tracks.

ODIN
Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed 
the express command of your King. 
Through your arrogance and 
stupidity, you have opened these 
peaceful Realms and innocent lives 
to the horrors of war. The 
Allfather plunges Gungnir into 
Observatory's control panel. The 
turret turns, the Bifrost energy 
building along with Odin's rage. It 
FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the 
end of the platform, creating a 
portal behind Thor. Odin turns 
angrily to his son.

ODIN (CONT'D)
You are unworthy of this Realm... 
Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

ODIN (CONT'D)

44.


ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of your title... He 
rips away Thor's cloak.

ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of the loved ones 
you've betrayed. I hereby take from 
you your powers. Odin extends his 
hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes 
flying from Thor's grasp into 
Odin's hand.

ODIN (CONT'D)
In the name of my father... A 
FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the 
hammer and hits Thor, 
disintegrating the right arm of his 
armor and part of the chest piece.

ODIN (CONT'D)
...and of his father before... 
Another strike disintegrates the 
remainder of Thor's armor, 
including the cape and torn-away 
disc on the floor.

ODIN (CONT'D)
I cast you out!

Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF 
THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost 
and disappears in the vortex.

Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He 
closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something 
quietly.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he 
be worthy, shall possess the power 
of Thor.

RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into 
its smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then 
disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into 
the Bifrost.

CUT TO BLACK.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's 
blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. 

45.


It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS 
into him, as we:

CUT TO BLACK.

After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

DARCY (V.O.)
I think that was legally your 
fault.

JANE (V.O.)
Get the first aid kit.

(THEN)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and 
don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes 
and look at me.

THOR'S POV
Thor opens his eyes to see Jane 
Foster staring at him, concerned. 
She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

DARCY (O.S.)
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I 
know CPR.

END THOR'S POV

TIME CUT TO:

Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their 
heads. A thought strikes her.

JANE
(TO SELVIG)
Where did he come from? They 
exchange puzzled looks when Thor 
GROANS again. He sits up abruptly, 
and Jane topples backwards in 
surprise. Thor staggers groggily to 
his feet, then turns and offers 
Jane a hand up. She takes it 
hesitantly, and he easily pulls her 
up. She can't help but marvel at 
his strength.

JANE (CONT'D)
Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor 
searches the ground.

THOR
Hammer...

46.


DARCY
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. 
That's pretty obvious. Jane notices 
something on the ground around 
them. She shines her flashlight 
down at the sand.

JANE
Erik... look at this. He joins her 
at her side and sees it. A faint, 
discernible pattern is etched into 
the sand. They exchange a look. 
Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly 
takes out a camera and snaps some 
photos of the runes. A breeze 
begins to blow them away.

JANE (CONT'D)
We've got to move fast before 
anything changes.

JANE (CONT'D)
We need soil samples, light 
readings, everything. She pulls out 
a light meter, holds it up, takes 
some readings, jots them down in 
her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, 
who stares up at the sky.

SELVIG
Jane, we need get him to a 
hospital.

Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the 
cannister.

JANE
Not right now. It'll take too long. 
County's an hour away. We'll drop 
him off after we're done here.

Selvig looks uncertain.

JANE (CONT'D)
(RE: THOR)
Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares 
up at the stars, shouts up at them 
angrily.

THOR
Father! Heimdall! I know you can 
hear me! Open the bridge!

47.


JANE
(off Selvig's look)
Okay, you and Darcy take him to the 
hospital, I'll stay here.

SELVIG
You expect me to leave you alone in 
the middle of the desert? Thor 
turns to the others, frustrated.

THOR
You! What world is this? The group 
is intimidated by his fervor.

SELVIG
It's all right, my friend. We're 
going to get you some help. Selvig 
touches Thor's shoulder. Thor 
shoves him off, grows agitated, 
belligerent.

THOR
Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy 
reaches into her fanny pack, pulls 
something out of it. Jane looks on, 
concerned.

JANE
Erik, just back away...

SELVIG
(to Thor, calming)
You're in the desert outside the 
town of Puente Antiguo.

THOR
What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

DARCY
Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a 
TASER at him. Thor looks at the 
weapon, unsure what to make of it.

THOR
You dare threaten Thor with so puny

A--
Darcy fires, the electrified wires 
shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING 
him in the chest. Thor convulses, 
falls to the ground unconscious. 
Jane and Selvig stare at her, 
shocked.

48.


DARCY
What? He was freaking me out.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle 
to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
Next time you decide to taser 
someone, do me a favor and make 
sure they're already inside the 
truck.

(TO JANE)
Jane, come on... Reluctantly, Jane 
joins the others inside the SUV.

EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high 
overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost 
energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing 
into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a 
meteor.

Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two 
ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy 
stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
Name?

JANE
He said it was "Thor."¬ù The Nurse 
painstakingly types it into the 
computer, one key at a time. Jane 
watches as Thor is wheeled out of 
the room.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SPELLING)
T-H-O-R. And your relationship to 
him?

49.


JANE
I've never met him before.

DARCY
Until she hit him with the car.

JANE
Grazed him, actually.

(THEN)
Oh, and we tasered him, too.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SYMPATHETIC)
Must have been quite the spat.

JANE
I told you, I don't know him. I 
just want to make sure he's okay.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
I'm going to need a name and 
contact number.

JANE
Jane Foster.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(TYPING SLOWLY)

J...A...N...

SELVIG
Oh, for God's sake... He reaches 
over Jane's shoulder and hands the 
Nurse his business card.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
Here. Let's go.

Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens 
on a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in 
his arm.

NURSE
Hi. Just taking a little blood. 
Thor SLAPS the syringe away 
angrily, starts to sit up.

50.


THOR
How dare you attack the son of 
Odin!

NURSE
I need some help! Two ORDERLIES 
race over, try to hold Thor down.

NURSE (CONT'D)
We're trying to help you!

THOR
Then bring me a healing stone, you 
savages!

He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a 
couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all 
struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, 
furniture overturned.

ORDERLY
What the hell is this guy on? 
Finally, they force him back down 
onto the gurney. Thor looks shocked 
and amazed that he's actually being 
overpowered by this small group. 
The NURSE injects him with a 
sedative.

THOR
You're no match for the Mighty-- 
Thor struggles a beat, then passes 
out.

Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls 
his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out, 
peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

TOWNIE
Huh.

The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater. 
We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an 
otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object, 
tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts, 
strains with all his might, with no luck. He takes off his 
hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object.

TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Huh.

EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. 
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast 
desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at 
her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer 
churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost 
footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the 
scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a 
monitor which displays a complex program entitled "J. FOSTER 
ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"¬ù. He looks proud. The three of them 
have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement.

JANE
Darcy, when you're done, take the 
soil samples to Professor Meyers in 
geology. Remind him, he owes me.

SELVIG
We might want to perform a spectral 
analysis.

JANE
"We?"¬ù

SELVIG
I flew all the way out here -- 
might as well make myself useful. 
This is the offer Jane's been 
waiting for. She gets up, inserts 
the piece of equipment she's been 
working on into a rack-mounted 
server.

JANE
You know what would be really 
useful? Do you still have that 
friend at LIGO?

SELVIG
She was more than a friend.

JANE
Could you call in a favor?

SELVIG
You don't think this was just a 
magnetic storm?

JANE
If I'm right, their observatory 
must have picked up gravitational 
waves during last night's event.

52.


SELVIG
Meaning?

Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

JANE
Meaning these anomalies might 
signify something bigger.

SELVIG
How "big"¬ù are we talking about? 
Jane indicates the footage on the 
monitor. As the last of the Bifrost 
cloud disappears into the night 
sky, there appears to be a blister 
in space, bulging out in convex and 
covered with stars.

JANE
I think the lensing around the 
edges is characteristic of an 
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

DARCY
A what?

SELVIG
I thought you were a science major.

DARCY
Political Science. Selvig shoots 
Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

JANE
She was the only applicant.

SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a 
"theoretical"¬ù connection between 
two different points of space-time. 
Darcy stares blankly.

JANE
(TO DARCY)
A wormhole.

Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the 
monitor.

JANE (CONT'D)
Erik, look...

53.


Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen 
through the "bubble"¬ù in the clouds.

JANE (CONT'D)
What do you see here?

SELVIG
Stars.

JANE
Yes. But not our stars. She spreads 
out a STAR CHART, barely able to 
contain her excitement.

JANE (CONT'D)
This is the star alignment for our 
quadrant, this time of year. So 
unless Ursa Minor decided to take 
the day off... those are someone 
else's constellations. Selvig's 
intrigued, in spite of himself. 
Darcy pulls another frame-grab of 
the Bifrost footage from the 
printer and hangs it on the wall, 
when something in the image catches 
her eye.

DARCY
Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig 
examine the photo, amazed.

SELVIG
Is that...?

JANE
I think I left something at the 
hospital.

As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost 
funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable 
shape of a MAN.

ODIN
Do you understand what he set in 
motion? He's taken us to the brink 
of war!

FRIGGA
But banishment? You would lose him 
forever? He's your son!

ODIN
What would you have done?

FRIGGA
I would not have exiled him to a 
world of mortals, stripped of his 
powers, to suffer alone. I would 
not have had the heart for such 
cruelty!

ODIN
That is why I'm King.

(THEN)
I, too, grieve the loss of our son. 
But there are some things that even 
I cannot undo.

FRIGGA
You can bring him back.

ODIN
No. His fate is in his own hands 
now.

Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his

his hands slips free from its 
restraint.

But... I'm his wife. Darcy stifles 
a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse 
looks doubtful.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
I thought you said you didn't know 
him.

JANE
I meant I barely know him anymore. 
The man he's become. He's changed. 
I mean, what woman really knows her 
husband, anyway?

None of us, dear. He's in Room

We find him.

SELVIG
Did you see what he did in there? I 
don't know if finding him is the 
best idea.

56.


JANE
I want to know what that thing was, 
and he may have the answers. We 
don't have a choice.

DARCY
Oo-kay.

She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

SELVIG
So we're just going to spend the 
rest of the day looking for him?

JANE
However long it takes. Jane puts 
the car in reverse and backs up, 
when --

BAM!

She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital 
scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

JANE

Let's get you some clothes.

INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

53

Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- 
shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a 
ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls 
out some fragile HEALING STONES. Neither the fire, nor the 
stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the 
wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow. 

57.


He crushes them to a powder. His comrades' injuries heal up 
at the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as 
Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on 
his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing 
touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at 
his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. 
It's undamaged, back to its normal color.

VOLSTAGG
We should never have let him go.

SIF
There was no stopping him.

FANDRAL
At least he's only banished, not 
dead. Which is what we'd all be if 
that guard hadn't told Odin where 
we'd gone.

VOLSTAGG
How did the guard even know? Loki 
stares at his arm.

LOKI
I told him.

FANDRAL
What?

LOKI
I told him to go to Odin after we'd 
left. Though he should be flogged 
for taking so long.

VOLSTAGG
You told the guard?

LOKI
I saved our lives! And Thor's. I 
had no idea Father would banish him 
for what he did.

SIF
Loki, you're the only one who can 
help Thor now. You must go to the 
Allfather and convince him to 
change his mind!

LOKI
And if I do, then what? I love Thor 
more dearly than any of you, but 
you know what he is. He's arrogant. 
He's reckless. He's dangerous. 
(MORE)

58.


You saw how he was today. Is that 
what Asgard needs from its King?

The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He 
leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

SIF
He may speak about the good of 
Asgard, but he's always been 
jealous of Thor.

VOLSTAGG
True, but we should be grateful to 
him. He did save our lives.

HOGUN
Laufey said there were traitors in 
the House of Odin. The others turn 
to the usually quiet Hogun.

FANDRAL
Why is it every time you choose to 
speak, it has to be something dark 
and ominous?

HOGUN
A master of magic could easily 
bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The 
others look to Hogun, understanding 
the implication.

VOLSTAGG
No! Surely not!

FANDRAL
Loki's always been one for 
mischief, but you're talking about 
something else entirely.

SIF
Who else could elude Heimdall's 
gaze with tricks of light and 
shadow?

VOLSTAGG
The ceremony was interrupted just 
before Thor was named King.

SIF
We should go to the Allfather.

LOKI (CONT'D)

59.


FANDRAL
And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, 
we think your son just betrayed the 
throne. And do us a favor. Bring 
back Thor. There's a good 
fellow!"¬ù

SIF
It's our duty. If any of our 
suspicions are right, then all of 
Asgard is in danger.

INT. VAULT - DAY 54
54
54

Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient 
Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, 
reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its 
pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, 
across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to 
separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow 
within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but 
Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming 
his whole body.

ODIN (O.S.)
Stop!

Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer 
goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin 
eyes Loki with dismay.

LOKI
Am I cursed?

ODIN
No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets 
the Casket back upon its pedestal, 
his body quickly returning to its 
normal form and color. He stares at 
his father.

LOKI
What am I?

ODIN
You're my son.

LOKI
What more than that? Odin doesn't 
answer. He looks suddenly weary, 
burdened. Loki sizes him up, 
realizes the truth.

60.


LOKI (CONT'D)
The Casket wasn't the only thing 
you took from Jotunheim that day, 
was it?

Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

ODIN
No.

(BEAT)
In the aftermath of the battle, I 
went into the Temple, and I found a 
baby. Small for a giant's offspring 
-- abandoned, suffering, left to 
die. Laufey's son. Loki is sent 
reeling by the revelation.

LOKI
Laufey's son...

He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun 
blood. Why would you take me?

ODIN
You were an innocent child.

LOKI
You took me for a purpose, what was 
it?

Odin doesn't answer.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Tell me!

ODIN
I thought we could unite our 
kingdoms one day, bring about an 
alliance, bring about a permanent 
peace... through you. But those 
plans no longer matter.

LOKI
So I am no more than another stolen 
relic, locked up here until you 
might have use of me.

ODIN
Why do you twist my words?

61.


LOKI
You could have told me what I was 
from the beginning. Why didn't you?

ODIN
You are my son. My blood. I wanted 
only to protect you from the truth.

LOKI
Because I am the monster parents 
tell their children about at night?

ODIN
Don't...

LOKI
It all makes sense now. Why you 
favored Thor all these years.

ODIN
Listen...

LOKI
Because no matter how much you 
claim to "love"¬ù me, you could 
never have a Frost Giant sitting on 
the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body 
begins to shake, he lifts his hand. 
It starts to move out of synch 
temporarily, leaving a trail, the 
effect of the Odinsleep 
approaching. Loki doesn't notice as 
Odin tries to fight it off.

ODIN
Listen to me!

Loki strides away towards the exit.

ODIN (CONT'D)
Loki!

Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, 
emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally 
takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. 
His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the 
world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards. 
Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a 
scream. He collapses to the stone floor. Loki, shocked, 
hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.

LOKI
Guards!

Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the 
sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59
59
59

It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on 
lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They 
watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed 
a line to take a turn with the mysterious object. One of 
them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up, the 
next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the 
effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their 
cell phones. They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a 
path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the 
crater's edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side 
and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck. He 
fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the 
chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

EAGER TOWNIE
This'll do it.

He yells to the driver.

EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, let 'er rip! The townsfolk 
watch as the pick-up's engine 
ROARS, then STRAINS, its wheels 
spinning futilely, until finally 
the rear of the truck, along with 
the back wheels and axles, break 
off and go flying.

People dive out of the way. The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his 
head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"¬ù LEE. He looks back, 
shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party continuing. They 
don't notice as --

ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM

An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in 
a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering 
below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the 
crater. He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the 
object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- 
MJOLNIR. He pulls out a phone.

In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks 
around for a t-shirt. Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, 
can't help but notice his reflection in the mirror. Darcy 
eyes his powerful build, rippling biceps.

DARCY
You know, for a crazy homeless guy, 
he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. 
Thor emerges from the back room, 
holding a t-shirt.

DARCY (CONT'D)
Hey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads 
over to Jane's work area, starts 
fiddling with the equipment there 
with interest. Jane hurries over to 
put a stop to it.

JANE
Excuse me... excuse me! She leads 
him away from the work station. 
Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the 
front, it bear a sticker which 
reads: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. 
DONALD BLAKE"¬ù. Thor looks at it, 
puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

JANE (CONT'D)
My ex.

Thor stares at her a beat.

JANE (CONT'D)
They're the only clothes I had 
that'll fit you. Sorry.

THOR
They will suffice. Thor turns his 
attention to the pictures of the 
Bifrost on the wall.

JANE
You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor 
studies the frame-grabs with 
interest. Jane points to his form 
in the Bifrost photo.

64.


JANE (CONT'D)
What were you doing, in that? He 
glances at it, dismissive.

THOR
What does anyone do in the Bifrost? 
Everyone stares at him. Selvig 
seems to recognize the word. Jane 
opens her notebook, quickly writes 
the word down. Thor moves close to 
her, eyes the notations and 
drawings within the book, curious.

SELVIG
(amused, skeptical)
The Bifrost...

Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close 
to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the 
book.

JANE
What exactly is the Bifrost?

THOR
(IGNORING HER)
This mortal form has grown weak.

JANE
BUT--

JANE (CONT'D)
Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

61

Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin 
lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the 
space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The 
walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting 
him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits 
at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to 
him.

FRIGGA
I asked him to be honest with you 
from the beginning. There should be 
no secrets in a family.

LOKI
So why did he lie?

65.


FRIGGA
He kept the truth from you so that 
you would never feel different. You 
are in every way our son, Loki, and 
we your family. You must know that.

Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
(RE: ODIN)
You can speak to him. He can see 
and hear us, even now.

LOKI
How long will it last?

FRIGGA
I don't know. This time is 
different. We were unprepared.

LOKI
I never get used to seeing him like 
this. The most powerful being in 
the Nine Realms lying helpless 
until his body is restored.

FRIGGA
But he's put it off for so long 
now, I fear...

Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her 
eyes.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
You're a good son. Loki sits there, 
uncertain how to react, uncertain 
how he really feels.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
We mustn't lose hope that your 
father will return to us. And your 
brother.

Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

LOKI
What hope is there for Thor?

FRIGGA
There's always a purpose to 
everything your father does. Thor 
may yet find a way home. Loki looks 
troubled by the revelation. 
(MORE)

66.


He rises, heads for the exit, when 
they hear the clatter of ARMORED 
FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching.

THE EINHERJAR GUARD

Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for 
the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is 
baffled.

FRIGGA
Thor is banished. The line of 
succession falls to you. Until he 
awakens, Asgard is yours.

The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another 
EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels 
before Loki, offers the spear to him.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Make your father proud. Loki 
reaches out tentatively, then takes 
it. He likes the feel of it in his 
hand.

INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local 
diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a 
huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates -- 
pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before 
him. Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

JANE
Now tell us exactly what happened 
to you last night. Thor looks her 
in the eyes, staring, intrigued. 
Jane gets flustered, looks away.

JANE (CONT'D)
Maybe start with how you got inside 
that cloud.

DARCY
And how you could eat an entire box 
of Pop-Tarts and still be this 
hungry.

Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of 
coffee.

THOR
(re: coffee mug)
This drink. I like it.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)

67.


DARCY
(to Thor, re: coffee)
Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela 
makes the best coffee in town.

Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

THOR
(CALLS OUT)
Another!

ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor 
from behind the counter.

JANE
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

(IN SPANISH)
Yo voy a pagar la taza. Isabela 
turns to a WAITRESS and starts 
venting quickly in Spanish.

ISABELA

(IN SPANISH)
Did you see that? The first time 
she brings a man in here, and he's 
a lunatic!

JANE
(to Thor, re: mug)
What was that?

He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

THOR
It was delicious. I want another.

JANE
Then you should just say so!

THOR
I just did.

JANE
I mean ask for it. Nicely.

THOR
I meant no disrespect.

JANE
All right, then no more smashing, 
deal?

68.


THOR
You have my word.

JANE
Good.

A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at 
the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them 
is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

ISABELA
Morning, Pete. Jake.

TOWNIE PETE
The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela 
pours them a couple cups of coffee.

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

ISABELA
What crater?

Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the 
Townies with interest.

TOWNIE PETE
They're saying some kind of 
satellite crashed in the desert.

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

We were having a good time with it till the Feds showed up, 
chased us out.

JANE
(to the Townies)
Excuse me, did you say there was a 
satellite crash?

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

Yep. They said it was radioactive. And I had my hands all 
over it.

(REALIZING)
I'm probably sterile now. Thor, 
unconcerned, prepares to dig into 
the giant pile of pancakes. Darcy 
is amazed by the sight.

69.


DARCY
Oh my God, this is going on 
Facebook.

Darcy whips out her cellphone.

DARCY (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Smile!

Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his 
massive stack of food.

SELVIG
(to the Townies)
What did the satellite look like?

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

I don't know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. 
Real heavy. Nobody could lift it. This gets Thor's 
attention.

Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake, 
and pulls the Townie around to face him.

THOR
Where?!

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

About twelve miles east of here. Thor grins, his spirits 
soaring, as he quickly strides out of the diner.

PETE
I wouldn't bother! Looked like the 
whole Army was coming in when we 
left!

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings. 
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

JANE
Where are you going?

THOR
Twelve miles east of here. He 
starts to stride determinedly down 
the street. Jane walks with him.

JANE
Why?

70.


THOR
To get what belongs to me.

JANE
So now you own a satellite?

THOR
It's not what they say it is.

JANE
Whatever it is, the government 
seems to think it's theirs. You 
intend to just walk in there and 
take it?

THOR
Yes.

He stops walking.

THOR (CONT'D)
If you take me there now, I'll tell 
you everything you wish to know.

JANE
Everything?

THOR
All the answers you seek will be 
yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. 
Darcy looks to the others.

DARCY
"Myeu-muh?"¬ù What's "Myeu-muh?"¬ù 
Jane studies Thor. He looks 
sincere. She's nearly swayed,

WHEN:

SELVIG
Jane.

He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much 
care for him.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO JANE)
Please don't do this.

JANE
You know what we saw last night. 
This can't be a coincidence. I want 
to know what's in that crater.

71.


SELVIG
I'm not talking about the crater. 
I'm talking about him.

JANE
He's promised us answers.

SELVIG
He's delusional! Listen to what 
he's saying! "Thor."¬ù "Bifrost."¬ù 
"Mjolnir."¬ù These are the stories 
I grew up with as a child!

JANE
I'd just be driving him out there, 
that's all.

SELVIG
It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and 
Darcy.

JANE
I'm sorry. I can't take you.

THOR
I understand. Then this is where we 
say goodbye.

He takes her hand and kisses it.

JANE
That's... thank you. Thor bows 
slightly to each of them.

THOR
Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... 
Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down 
the street. Selvig looks relieved.

SELVIG
Now... let's get back to the lab. 
We have work to do. Selvig and 
Darcy turn and start to go. Jane 
looks after Thor as he walks away 
down the street.

SIF

URGENTLY--
But as they raise their heads, they 
stop short to see --

LOKI
Sitting sprawled upon his father's 
throne. He wears his horned 
ceremonial headdress and holds 
GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the 
others look up, shocked at the 
sight before them.

VOLSTAGG
What is this?

LOKI
My friends... you haven't heard? I 
am now Ruler of Asgard.

FANDRAL
Where is Odin?

LOKI
Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. 
My mother fears he may never awaken 
again.

SIF
We would speak with her. Sif and 
the Warriors Three exchange a look. 
Loki notices.

LOKI
She has refused to leave my 
father's bedside. You can bring 
your "urgent"¬ù matter to me, your 
King.

Sif covers quickly.

SIF
We would ask you to end Thor's 
banishment.

73.


LOKI
My first command can not be to undo 
the Allfather's last. We're on the 
brink of war with Jotunheim. Our 
people must have a sense of 
continuity in order to feel safe in 
these difficult times. Sif and the 
Warriors Three trade looks, not 
liking any of this.

LOKI (CONT'D)
All of us must stand together, for 
the good of Asgard.

FANDRAL
Of course.

Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki 
stares after them.

Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by 
Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped

machine from her lab.

JANE

Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government

the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away. 
Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with 
scientific instruments and documents.

JANE
What the hell is going on here?! 
The Agents ignore her as Agent 
Coulson approaches.

COULSON
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

SHIELD.

Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows 
wary.

74.


JANE
I don't care who you work for, you 
can't do this!

SELVIG
Jane. This is more serious than you 
realize. Let it go.

JANE
Let it go?! This is my life!

COULSON
We're here investigating a security 
threat. We need to appropriate your 
equipment and all your atmospheric 
data.

JANE
By "appropriate"¬ù you mean 
"steal?"¬ù Instead of answering, 
Coulson gives her a check.

COULSON
This should more than compensate 
you for your trouble. She throws 
the check to the ground without 
looking at it.

JANE
I can't just pick up replacements 
from RadioShack! I made most of 
that equipment myself!

COULSON
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

JANE
And I'm sure I can sue you for 
violating my constitutional rights!

COULSON
We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He 
tries to walk away, but Jane blocks 
his path. She is fully herself, 
fueled by outrage.

JANE
So are we! We're on the verge of

UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
extraordinary.

Jane holds up her notebook.

75.


JANE
Everything I know about this 
phenomenon is in this lab and in 
this book, and no one has the right 
to take it from me. Coulson 
gestures to a nearby AGENT, who 
promptly plucks the notebook out of 
Jane's hands and adds it to the 
pile he's carrying. Jane is 
stunned.

COULSON
Thank you for your cooperation. He 
gets into a car. The cars and 
trucks pull away.

SELVIG

JANE
Look around! They took our back- 
ups. They took the back-ups of our 
back-ups.

DARCY
I just downloaded, like, thirty 
songs on there.

JANE
(TO DARCY)
Will you please stop talking about 
your iPod?!

(TO SELVIG)
Who are these people?

SELVIG
No one knows much about them. But I 
knew a scientist -- a pioneer in 
gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, 
and he was never heard from again.

76.


JANE
I'm not going to let them do this. 
I'm getting everything back.

SELVIG
Please, let me contact one of my 
colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some 
dealings with these people. I'll e- 
mail him and see if he can help.

DARCY
They took your laptop, too.

THOR
Then give me one of those, large 
enough to ride.

The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a 
CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane 
calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

JANE
You still want a lift?

"And though they're large, giants

Selvig sits at a computer terminal, 
finishing up his e-mail. Beside 
him, a KID flips through a book 
with interest. The Librarian stops 
mid-story and calls to the Kid 
pleasantly.

LIBRARIAN
Joshua, come sit down. It's story 
time.

The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks 
over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

"MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."¬Ù

He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on 
Scandinavian Mythology. It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE 
coming down from Asgard to earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, 
among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the 
ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently. He 
eyes the illustration, pondering.

by her excitement.

THOR
Many times. You're brave to do it.

JANE
They just stole my entire life's 
work. I really don't have anything 
left to lose.

THOR
But you're clever. Far more clever 
than anyone else in this Realm.

JANE
"This Realm?"¬ù Why do you talk 
like that?

THOR
You think me strange? Jane laughs, 
catches herself.

JANE
Yeah. Just a little.

THOR
Good strange or bad strange?

JANE
I'm not quite sure yet. She looks 
at him, sees him staring at her. 
She's lost in his gaze, distracted, 
when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She 
quickly turns her eyes forward, 
regains control of the car.

JANE (CONT'D)
Sorry.

She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

JANE (CONT'D)
Who are you? Really?

THOR
You'll see soon enough.

JANE
You promised me answers.

Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

THOR
What you seek -- it's a bridge.

JANE
A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen 
Bridge?

THOR
More like a rainbow bridge.

A beat.

JANE
God, I hope you're not crazy.

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, 
revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move 
closer, we see the glow comes from --

A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE

Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, 
barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence 
that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the 
complex. Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes 
lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle 
of the crater. Through the glass walls of the base's command 
trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work. 
Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD 
SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the 
object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir.

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through 
binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

JANE
That isn't a satellite crash. They 
would have hauled the wreckage 
away, not built a city around it. 
Thor shrugs out of his jacket and 
hands it to her.

THOR
You're going to need this.

JANE
Why?--

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and 
takes his jacket.

THOR
Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I 
will return what they stole from 
you.

80.


He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his 
request.

THOR (CONT'D)
Deal?

JANE
No! Look what's down there! You 
can't just walk in, grab our stuff, 
and walk out!

THOR
No.

Jane looks relieved.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'm going to fly out. Before she 
can react, he starts heading 
towards the crater. The first drops 
of rain begin to patter into the 
dust.

JANE
Wait...

But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

It shows an SAR shot of the area, 
laid over a terrain map.

TECHIE (CONT'D)
Tech's barely working as it is, 
with all the interference that 
thing's giving off. He gestures 
towards the hammer. He checks a 
computer.

TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hey, we've got a commercial 
aircraft coming in right over us, 
Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

SITWELL
Reroute it, like all the others.

TECHIE
Right. Can I get the passengers 
some free drinks for the trouble? 
Sitwell glares at him.

TECHIE (CONT'D)
(SHRUGS)
It'd be a nice gesture. The Techie 
types into the computer, when he 
notices something on another 
screen, holds up a hand.

TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hold a sec... we got something 
outside the fence, west side... He 
points at the screen. Through the 
haze, it shows a THERMAL IMAGE 
huddled beside the fence.

Looks like we're good here. Must 
have been another coyote. Just 
then, the Agents notice a section 
of the fence has been bent up from 
the ground, leaving a gap.

Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING 
illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a 
large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of 
the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

AGENT DELANCEY
Jackson?

The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver 
across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson 
slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise 
a shotgun at Thor. Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of 
DeLancey's hands and thrusts the hilt back, smashing the 
Agent's jaw. Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain 
slicker.

A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the

out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's recorded 
message.

SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. 
Please leave me a message. His 
voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, 
urgently.

JANE
Erik, okay, first of all, don't 
worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. 
More sounds of MAYHEM come from the 
base.

JANE (CONT'D)
But if you don't hear from me 
again, you might want to come out 
to the crater site and look for me. 
I kind of did what you said I 
shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She 
hangs up.

Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches 
across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the 
lit up site uneasily.

EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From 
the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him. As 
the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes 
towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the ground. 

84.


Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the 
fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As 
more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes 
cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. 
Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main 
entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light 
suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving 
across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor 
sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises 
his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He 
raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and 
catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then 
hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing 
the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who 
takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV 
roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. 
The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the 
shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.

The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches 
the crater lip. The vehicle careens over the edge of the 
crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels. 
The Technicians inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, 
tearing into the tunnel, sending sparks everywhere. The ATV 
finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around it and 
the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS 
round the corner. Thor knocks out the first Guard, then 
tackles the second. He hurries around the corner, when more 
GUARDS come up a ladder ahead. Thor punches the closest 
Guard, sending him tumbling backwards, toppling the others 
on the ladder behind him. Thor takes off running, as the 
Guards regroup and give chase. Thor spots the glow of 
Mjolnir in the central cube, through the translucent walls 
of the tunnels. He hurries through to tunnels to find a way 
towards it.

Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of 
AGENTS. Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, 
punching -- whatever it takes to keep moving. As he takes 
down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction box and the 
entrance to the cube structure up ahead. He races towards 
it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the middle of the 
structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a fist lands a 
powerful blow across his jaw, sending him reeling. Dazed, 
Thor looks up to see --

A HUGE SHIELD AGENT

The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer 
in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

his view. Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges 
forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, 
nailing the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down 
hard as Thor's momentum carries him past. Thor stands, heads 
for the cube structure, when the Huge Guard grabs his ankle 
in a last effort. Thor looks back down at his foe, then 
drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into the fallen 
Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain, defeated. 
Thor races back towards the structure.

From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of

with wet earth. His hammer rests just a few yards before 
him, energy surging around it. Coulson steps into the 
structure through an access tunnel, one story up.

As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow 
brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The 
crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices, 
his interest piqued. Above the open ceiling of the

the hammer doesn't move. Thor looks confused, tries again 
with two hands, to no avail -- anger and frustration 
overtaking him. He strains with all his might, SCREAMS from 
the effort, bellowing up at the storm and lightning above 
him. Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- 
glowing RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them. But, still, the 
hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his knees before it, 
rain pouring down around him, as the glowing runes fade 
away. He's failed. Unworthy. Coulson looks on, disappointed. 
SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding 
him. Coulson activates his radio.

COULSON
Ground units, move in. Show's over.

As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or 
care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the 
rain -- a man broken, lost. From overhead, we see the hammer 
in the cube containment room. We pull up as the Guards 
approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the 
whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it

Aren't you the one who's always

was it, South Africa? Still no 
answer. Coulson leans in close to

One way or another, we find out

What?

LOKI
Your banishment, the threat of a 
new war, it was too much for him to 
bear.

The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's 
responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, 
looks in his eyes, consolingly.

LOKI (CONT'D)
You mustn't blame yourself. I know 
that you loved him. I tried to tell 
him so, but he wouldn't listen.

LOKI (CONT'D)

LOKI
The truce with Jotunheim is 
conditional upon your exile.

Mother has forbidden your return.

well, you know the rest.

COULSON
Uh-huh. You mind if we take a 
moment to verify his identity?

SELVIG
Certainly.

The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

You can understand how a man could 
go off like that. I mean, a big, 
faceless organization like yours, 
coming in with their jack-booted 
thugs and stealing private 
property...

COULSON
That doesn't explain how he managed

nut.

On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New 
York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE"¬ù. The license photo 
is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her 
cellphone.

The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD 
SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."¬ù Coulson eyes the screen. 
After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

COULSON
It says here he's an M.D.

SELVIG
He is. That is, he was. He switched 
careers and became a physicist. 
He's quite brilliant, really.

If you would just release him to

COULSON
Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig 
here.

The Techie looks to him, surprised.

COULSON (CONT'D)
(TO SELVIG)
Make sure he stays in town for the 
next few days in case we need to 
talk to him again. Selvig shakes 
his hand.

SELVIG
Thank you.

INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a 
seated Thor.

SELVIG
Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are!

Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig 
pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
It's going to be all right, my 
friend. Come on, I'm taking you 
home.

He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security 
Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the 
Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand- 
written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes 
it from the pile and pockets it.

INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV 
record. 

97.


A security warning over the image clearly reads "SECURITY 
ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."¬ù He knows it's been a ruse all 
along. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the 
Security Room, then follows them outside.

EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with 
Thor away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

COULSON
Just keep him away from the bars.

SELVIG
I will!

THOR
(TO SELVIG)
Where are we going? Selvig drops 
his cool demeanor.

SELVIG
To get a drink.

Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, 
Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE.

COULSON
Follow them.

EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy 
surface of the planet.

INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

95

Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of 
light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. 
Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. 
Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

LAUFEY
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

LOKI
I've come alone and unarmed.

LAUFEY
To what end?

LOKI
To make you another proposition.

98.


LAUFEY
(REALIZING)
So you're the one who let us into 
Asgard.

LOKI
You're welcome.

LAUFEY
My men are dead, and I have no 
Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey 
lashes out, grabs Loki around the 
throat, but Loki calmly stands his 
ground.

LOKI
You have no idea what I am. The 
blueness spreads across his face, 
as Laufey and the guards stare in 
shock. Loki grins.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Hello, Father.

Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. 
Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

LAUFEY
Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin 
had killed you. That's what I would 
have done. He's as weak as you are.

LOKI
No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, 
until Odin awakens. Perhaps you 
should not have so carelessly 
abandoned me.

This gives Laufey pause.

LAUFEY
Or perhaps it was the wisest choice 
I've ever made. I will hear you.

LOKI
I will conceal you and a handful of 
your soldiers, lead you into his 
chambers, and let you slay him 
where he lies. I'll keep the 
throne, and you will have the 
Casket.

Laufey studies Loki's face.

99.


LAUFEY
Why would you do this?

LOKI
When all is done, we will have a 
permanent peace between our two 
worlds. Then I, the bastard son, 
will have accomplished what Odin 
and Thor never could.

LAUFEY
This is a great day for Jotunheim. 
Asgard is finally ours.

LOKI
No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the 
Nine Realms will be yours, if you 
do as you're told. Laufey considers 
the proposition.

LAUFEY
I accept.

Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a 
smile crosses his face.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96
96
96

Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from 
his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

LOKI
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

HEIMDALL
I turned my gaze upon you in 
Jotunheim, but could neither see 
nor hear you. You were shrouded 
from me, like the Frost Giants who 
entered this Realm.

LOKI
Perhaps your senses have weakened 
after your many years of service.

HEIMDALL
Or perhaps someone has found a way 
to hide that which he does not wish 
me to see.

Loki sizes him up, smiles.

100.


LOKI
You have great power, Heimdall. 
Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

HEIMDALL
No.

LOKI
And why is that?

HEIMDALL
Because he is my King, and I am 
sworn to obey him.

LOKI
Exactly. Just as you're sworn to 
obey me now. Yes? A beat.

HEIMDALL
Yes.

LOKI
Good. Then you will open the 
Bifrost to no one until I have 
undone what my brother has started. 
Loki heads out of the Observatory. 
Heimdall stares after him.

INT. BAR - NIGHT 97
97
97

Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local 
dive. The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two 
shots of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and 
downs it. Thor follows his example.

SELVIG
Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, 
but a talented hacker.

THOR
Thank you for what you've done.

SELVIG
Don't thank me. I only did it for 
Jane.

THOR
Are you in love with her?

SELVIG
Of course not! Jane's like a 
daughter to me. Her father and I 
taught at University together. 
(MORE)

101.


A good man, but he never listened. 
This registers with Thor.

THOR
Neither did I.

Selvig eyes him with interest.

SELVIG
I don't know if you're really 
delusional, and I really don't care 
at this point. I just care about 
her. I've seen the way she looks at 
you.

THOR
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

SELVIG
Good. If that's the case, then I'll 
buy you one more drink, and you'll 
leave town tonight. A long pause, 
then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

THOR
I had it all backwards. I had it 
all wrong.

Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than 
he's seen before.

SELVIG
It's not a bad thing, finding out 
that you don't have all the 
answers. That's when you start 
asking the right questions. Thor 
takes this in.

THOR
For the first time in my life, I 
have no idea what I'm supposed to 
do.

SELVIG
Anyone who's ever going to find 
their way in this world has to 
start by admitting they don't know 
where the hell they are. Thor nods.

DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
Hey, I know you, man... An 
intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby 
sizes up Thor. 

SELVIG (CONT'D)

(MORE)

102.


He is one of the Townies from 
Isabela's Diner who saw Thor 
earlier. He approaches, belligerent 
and looking for a fight.

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
You were in the diner with that hot 
girl.

Thor doesn't like where this is going.

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
I wouldn't mind her doing a little 
research on me.

He laughs. Thor is annoyed.

THOR
I have no quarrel with you. But 
she's a lady. You should be more 
respectful.

DRUNK TOWNIE
And you should shut the hell up, 
princess.

Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the 
Townie's baiting.

THOR
I will not fight him.

DRUNK TOWNIE
Then it'll be easy to kick your 
ass.

Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

SELVIG
Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
heads.

Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. 
Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his 
glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Another drink?

DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

103.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98
98
98

Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN 
FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance 
routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically 
in time with the song.

THOR/SELVIG

(SINGING)
"The mood is good, our hearts are 
full, there's magic in the air. / 
It's all because we're here 
tonight, and haven't got a care. / 
So raise a glass, and toast to 
life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- 
la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine 
indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a 
friend is fine indeed!"¬ù Thor 
holds up a hand for Selvig's last 
finishing slap. Selvig misses it 
completely and falls out of frame 
like a straight dead weight with a 
CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from 
behind the car where Selvig fell, 
Thor stands up, Selvig slung over 
his shoulder, and starts to walk up 
the street towards Jane's trailer.

INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99
99
99

The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, 
strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried 
Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the 
loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it 
to find --

THOR
Standing there with the unconscious 
Selvig slung over his shoulder.

JANE
Erik!

(TO THOR)
Is he all right?

THOR
He's fine. Not injured at all.

As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway. 
Selvig GROANS.

104.


THOR (CONT'D)
Sorry, my friend.

JANE
What happened?

THOR
We drank. We fought. He made his 
ancestors proud.

JANE
Put him on the bed. Thor moves 
through the small trailer carrying 
Selvig, like a bear lugging another 
bear, smashing into things along 
the way, until he finally sets 
Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig 
awakens groggily and looks up at 
him through bleary eyes.

SELVIG
I still don't believe you're the 
God of Thunder.

(THEN)
But you ought to be. Thor grins, 
pats him on the cheek. As Selvig 
drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a 
blanket over him. Jane watches, 
stunned by their friendship, 
impressed by Thor's tenderness. 
Thor turns back to her, looks 
around.

THOR
These are your chambers? Jane 
suddenly becomes self-conscious. 
She starts cleaning up the mess 
around her.

JANE
Well, it's more of a temporary 
living space, really. I don't 
usually have visitors in here. 
Actually, never... Thor picks up a 
sock off the floor. She snatches it 
from him, puts it away.

JANE (CONT'D)
Can we go outside?

105.


EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100
100
100

Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He 
offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set 
up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

JANE
I come up here sometimes when I 
can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to 
reconcile particle data. Or when 
Darcy's driving me crazy.

(THEN)
I come up here a lot, now that I 
think about it.

Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

JANE
I'm glad you're safe.

THOR
You've been very kind. I've been 
far less grateful than you deserve.

JANE
I also hit you with my car a couple 
times, so it kind of evens out. He 
grins, then reaches into his pocket 
and pulls out her

NOTEBOOK.

JANE
I don't believe it... She takes it 
from him, surprised and grateful.

THOR
It was all I could get back. Not as 
much as I promised. I'm sorry.

JANE
No, this is good. Thank you. This 
means I don't have to start from 
scratch...

She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a 
harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

THOR
What's wrong?

106.


JANE
SHIELD, whatever they are. They're 
never going to let this research 
see the light of day.

THOR
You must do this. You must finish 
what you've started.

JANE
Why?

THOR
Because you're right. It's taken so 
many generations for your people to 
get to this point. You're nearly 
there. You just need someone to 
show you how close you really are.

Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page 
which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from 
the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one 
point to another in space.

THOR (CONT'D)
Look -- your ancestors called it 
magic. You call it science. I come 
from a place where they're one and 
the same thing. We recognize that 
Thor is drawing the branches of 
Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed 
and intrigued.

JANE
What is it?

THOR
This is how my father explained it 
to me...

(THEN)
Your world is one of the Nine 
Realms of the Cosmos, linked to 
each other by the branches of 
Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, 
you see it every day, without 
realizing. Images glimpsed through -
- what did you call it?...
(checks her notebook)
...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine 
Realms...

They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is going 
to be a long night.

107.

Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He 
stares up at the night sky. She rolls close to him, nuzzles 
against him in her sleep. He looks down at her, beautiful in 
the moonlight, looks out at the town beyond her.

INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands 
nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously 
as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can 
stand it no more.

FANDRAL
Our dearest friend banished, Loki 
on the throne, Asgard on the brink 
of war, yet you manage to consume 
four wild boar, six pheasant, a 
side of beef, and two casks of ale. 
Shame on you! Don't you care?! 
Fandral moves to throw the platter 
in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his 
weapon, stopping him.

VOLSTAGG
Do not mistake my appetite for 
apathy.

SIF
Stop it, both of you! We all know 
what we have to do, we're just too 
damned afraid to do it!

HOGUN
(DECIDES)
We must go. We must find Thor. 
Hogun starts to pull the delicate 
HEALING STONES from the fire, 
carefully putting them into a POUCH 
at his side.

FANDRAL
It's treason, Hogun.

VOLSTAGG
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

(SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
Now, shh! Heimdall may be watching! 
It's said he can hear--

FANDRAL
Yes, yes, we know!

108.


SIF
Thor would do the same for us. An 
EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

EINHERJAR GUARD
Heimdall demands your presence. 
Volstagg quickly drains his flagon 
of ale.

VOLSTAGG
We're doomed.

He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig 
emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane. Selvig 
eyes the two of them together, then:

SELVIG
I need some coffee. The three head 
inside Smith Motors.

FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET

SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a 
small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor 
holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She 
scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the 
table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

DARCY
Thanks.

THOR
You're very welcome. Jane joins 
them at the card table with a 
couple more plates.

On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents

their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab 
window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-
link, turns to Cale.

AGENT GARRETT
They want an update.

AGENT CALE
Tell them he's eating eggs.

AGENT GARRETT
Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at 
him.

AGENT CALE

Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll 
keep you posted.

leaves.

In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. 
(Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop 
tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see 
Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a 
MUG.

THOR (CONT'D)

110.


THOR
To replace the one I broke. Please 
forgive my behavior.

She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

ISABEL
Okay. Thank you.

THOR
If I may, I'd like to come back for 
more of your "coffee."¬ù

ISABEL
Any time.

He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and 
shrugs.

ISABEL (CONT'D)
She could do worse.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the 
intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's 
controls. He glares at them accusingly.

VOLSTAGG
Good Heimdall, less us explain--

HEIMDALL
You would defy the commands of Loki 
our King, break every oath you have 
taken as warriors, and commit 
treason to bring Thor back? The 
four exchange nervous glances.

SIF
Yes, but--

HEIMDALL
Good.

The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

VOLSTAGG
So you'll help us?

HEIMDALL
I am bound by honor to our King. I 
cannot open the Bifrost to you. 
(MORE)

111.


With that, Heimdall leaves them 
alone in the Observatory. The 
others exchange puzzled looks.

FANDRAL
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

VOLSTAGG
Now what do we do? Sif glances at 
the control panel, notices 
something.

SIF
Look!

The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the 
control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif 
hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite 
footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

COULSON
What the hell was that?

TECHIE
I don't know, sir. We got massive 
energy readings out of nowhere, 
then they just disappeared. Fifteen 
miles due northwest.

COULSON
Let's go take a look.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

111

Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and 
Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They 
clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the 
hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes 
cover the desert sand around them.

VOLSTAGG
He must have landed nearby. It's 
time to put our tracking skills to 
work. Spread out. Check the sand 
for indentations of his boot 
prints.

HEIMDALL (CONT'D)

112.


FANDRAL
The winds would have blown them 
away by now. We should look for 
signs of a campfire.

SIF
Or we could just start there. She 
points behind them to the town of 
Puente Antiguo in the distance -- 
the only visible sign of 
civilization -- and to Hogun, who 
has already started walking towards 
it. Volstagg and Fandral trade 
looks, their egos bruised.

FANDRAL
It's worth a look, I suppose. The 
party tromps towards the town.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as 
they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He 
runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
up with one hand.

Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.

VOLSTAGG
There you go, lad! The boy just 
stares, standing frozen. The 
Asgardians head off.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Is it just me, or does Earth look a 
little different to you?

SIF
It has been a thousand years...

VOLSTAGG
Things change so fast here. You 
leave for a millennium, and it's 
like the whole neighborhood's gone. 
Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

113.


VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Perhaps we should split up.

Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking 
down the street.

AGENT GARRETT
Is there a Renaissance Faire in 
town?

AGENT CALE
Call it in.

But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes 
their heads together. They're out.

VOLSTAGG
Never cared for spies. He starts to 
go, then sees their bag of fast 
food on the ground. Intrigued, he 
pulls out a cheeseburger and takes 
a bite. He likes what he tastes.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Exquisite.

Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an 
Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

EINHERJAR GUARD
My liege, the Warriors Three and 
the Lady Sif have gone missing. 
Loki reacts. He knows who's 
responsible.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

116

Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

HEIMDALL
Tell me, Loki, how did you get the 
Jotuns into Asgard?

LOKI
You think the Bifrost is the only 
way in and out of the Realm? There 
are secret paths between worlds to 
which even you with all your gifts 
are blind. But I have need of them 
no longer, now that I am King.

114.


(THEN)
And I say, for your act of treason, 
you are relieved of your duties as 
Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a 
citizen of Asgard.

HEIMDALL
Then I need no longer obey you. 
Heimdall raises his massive sword, 
strides towards Loki. Loki reaches 
out and, with both hands, takes 
hold of something invisible, 
hovering in mid-air before him. As 
it quickly fades into view, we 
realize what it is --

THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.

The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki 
opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. 
From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of 
the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but 
SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight 
towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but 
still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall 
is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword 
at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from 
Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past 
him.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel 
and opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER 
appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns 
its head toward its King.

Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying

VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
Found you!

Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE

Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying 
dishes in mortal clothing. Jane drops a plate. It goes 
SHATTERING on the floor.

THOR
My friends!

Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, 
Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. 
Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.

SELVIG
I don't believe it...

DARCY
Who are they?

VOLSTAGG
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. 
Surely you've heard tales of Hogun 
the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and 
I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig 
looks pointedly at Volstagg's 
massive gut.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Well, perhaps I've put on a little 
more muscle since I was here last.

JANE
That would have been a thousand 
years ago? Northern Europe?

VOLSTAGG
Exactly! Those lovely herring 
people. They worshipped us! Thor 
grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's 
shoulder.

THOR
My friends, I've never been happier 
to see anyone. But you should not 
have come.

FANDRAL
We're here to take you home. Jane 
reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

THOR
You know I can't. My father is dead 
because of me. I must remain in 
exile.

The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

SIF
Thor... your father still lives. 
Thor reacts to the revelation.

A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few 
SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings. 
Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an 
Agent.

COULSON
Get somebody from Linguistics out 
here.

Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost 
storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents 
scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as 
the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in 
the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of 
it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the 
Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at 
the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it 
moves towards them.

SHIELD AGENT
(RE: DESTROYER)
Is that one of Stark's?

COULSON
I don't think so. But the guy 
doesn't tell me anything.

Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the 
Destroyer.

117.


COULSON (CONT'D)
Hello! You're using unregistered 
weapons technology. Please identify 
yourself. We hear the HUM of the 
Destroyer's fiery energy power up 
inside.

As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy 
from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return 
fire.

Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in

Thor turns to Jane.

THOR
Leave this town now. Get yourself 
and your friends to safety.

JANE
What about you?

THOR
I must stay and fight. The 
Asgardians look to Thor.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'm still a warrior, and I will 
fight by your side.

VOLSTAGG
You're but a mortal now. You'll get 
yourself killed!

FANDRAL
Or one of us, trying to protect 
you.

SIF
The best thing you can do is get 
the mortals to safety and leave the 
battle to us.

Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to 
the oncoming threat.

THOR
(TO SIF)
You're right.

118.


Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

THOR (CONT'D)
Help me clear the streets. I'll let 
none of these people die this day.

Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of 
Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif 
head across town, towards the Destroyer.

A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in

Volstagg grins eagerly.

"The Flying Mountain."¬ù Hogun and

Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the 
Warriors Three get into position before the Destroyer.

THOR
(TO JANE)
My friends fight bravely, but they 
won't be able to hold it back much 
longer.

Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many 
animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

DOWN THE STREET

Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as 
Volstagg stands limbering up.

FANDRAL
(TO VOLSTAGG)
Come on!

Volstagg takes off running at full speed. As he catches up 
to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him on either side, 
and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the voluminous 
warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

VOLSTAGG
For Asgaaaaard!!!

120.


The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg 
SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually 
work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It 
lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs 
apologetically. The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun 
and Fandral, smashing into them, when --

SIF
Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her 
two-headed spear and plunges it 
deep into the back of the creature. 
The creature stands there 
motionless, the fire dimming in its 
faceplate, Sif standing atop its 
back. The Asgardians have a brief 
moment of hope. But the creature 
stirs with life, its fire igniting 
once again. Sif looks on with 
growing trepidation. Slowly, 
unnaturally, the Destroyer spins 
its torso around 180 degrees to 
face its attackers. The Destroyer 
unleashes a blast at Sif. She 
barely dives off of the behemoth in 
time, dodging the blast. The 
Destroyer rises again to its full 
height, pulling free from Sif's 
staff, the weapon slipping through 
the slats of its armor. Sif and the 
Warriors Three try to regroup, when 
the Destroyer unleashes another 
blast, sending Sif and her comrades 
flying in all directions. Hogun's 
POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks 
free, landing in the middle of the 
street.

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has 
no time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction. A 
storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane, 
and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when 
they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris, 
impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

JANE
Erik!

She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going 
into shock.

121.


SELVIG
(TO JANE)
Go! Leave me!

Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing 
stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break 
for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the 
pouch and races back. He opens the pouch to find the fragile 
stones crushed and useless. He pours the contents out in his 
hand.

THOR
Come on... give me one! Amidst the 
useless powder, he finally finds 
one stone still intact. Thor tosses 
the pouch aside, holds the stone 
over the end of the iron rod.

JANE
What are you doing? What is that? 
As the stone begins to glow, Thor 
crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, 
as the glowing powder falls upon 
the piece of iron, dissolving it, 
heading downwards, until it reaches 
Selvig's wound. The powder heals 
his wound completely.

Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still 
lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He 
reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed 
flesh.

SELVIG
(to Jane, re: Thor)
I'm really starting to like him. 
Jane turns to Thor to find he's 
gone.

EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on 
the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

THOR
Go, while you can!

SIF
But the others...

THOR
You can't help them now. Your job 
is to survive.

122.


She struggles to sit up.

SIF
No! I will die a warrior's death. 
Stories will be told of this day-- 
He gently takes her shield from 
her.

THOR
Live and tell those stories 
yourself.

At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, 
with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way 
towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to 
pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He 
rouses Hogun and Fandral.

THOR (CONT'D)
(RE: VOLSTAGG)
Get him out of here!

FANDRAL
No. We can still fight!

THOR
But not win. Move Volstagg, or 
he'll die!

Thor looks at them, grins.

THOR (CONT'D)
Don't worry, my friends. I have a 
plan.

The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and 
drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor 
turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield 
aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, 
completely defenseless.

THOR (CONT'D)
Brother... for whatever I have done 
to wrong you, whatever I have done 
to lead you to do this, I am sorry. 
But these people have done nothing 
to you. They are innocents. He 
continues towards the Destroyer.

THOR (CONT'D)
Take my life, and know I will never 
return to Asgard.

123.


Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer 
hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him 
with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of 
breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a 
crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, 
Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly 
from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane 
tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

SELVIG
Jane, no!

He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, 
watching the scene --

Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The 
Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards 
him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to 
unleash its fiery blast.

EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir 
reappear, burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on 
the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it 
vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. 
Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and 
flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air 
like a rocket.

EXT. MAIN STREET 136

The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

KRAKAKABOOM!

A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, 
colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is 
massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust 
enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

JANE
Oh. My. God.

124.


THE MIGHTY THOR

Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand -- 
the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir 
down onto the ground.

KRAKABOOM!

Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings 
Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the 
Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder 
God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale 
force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into 
the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its 
massive weight.

It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its 
faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor 
dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. 
Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, 
overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at 
the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the 
Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature 
builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his 
openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a 
tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished 
forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away 
from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and 
debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from 
the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's 
comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson 
approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

COULSON

completely honest with me.

Darcy turns to Volstagg.

DARCY

Then I suppose we'd best start 
settling into our new lives. He 
looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Are all earth maidens as fair as

Darcy enjoys the attention.

DARCY
No.

Thor shouts back up to the sky.

THOR

From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him. 
Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters 
all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With a 
tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice. 
Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the 
Observatory.

The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD 
Agent's machine gun.

VOLSTAGG
Primitive. Good enough for hunting 
small game, I suppose. Suddenly, 
the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the 
sky. Thor grins. The mortals look 
on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

126.


FANDRAL
Sorry, my love. These things 
happen.

He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to 
Coulson.

THOR
Know this, son of Coul. You and I, 
we fight for the same cause -- the 
protection of this world. From this 
day forward, count me as your ally.

(THEN)
If you return the items you have 
stolen from Jane Foster.

COULSON
Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots 
him a look. Coulson quickly 
continues.

COULSON (CONT'D)
You'll get your equipment back. 
You're going to need it to continue 
your research... which, after 
today's events, SHIELD would like 
to fully sponsor. If that's all 
right with you.

Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at 
him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see 
him again.

THOR
Whatever fate lies before me, you 
are part of it.

He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and 
the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall

Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears 
the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga

angrily. Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter. Laufey 
looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

LAUFEY
It's said you can still see and 
hear what transpires around you, 
even in this state. I hope it's 
true, so that you may know your 
death came by the hand of Laufey. 
He raises his blade above Odin's 
body, when --

A BLAST OF ENERGY

Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground, 
we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding 
Gungnir.

LOKI
And your death came by the son of 
Odin.

Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for 
Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall, 
taking him out.

The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, 
his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

REVEALING --

FRIGGA
Standing behind him -- the sword 
stuck in his back. She looks to 
Loki, takes him in her arms.

LOKI
I swear to you, mother, they will 
pay for what they've done today. I 
will end the Jotun threat, now and 
forever!

He looks to Odin.

LOKI (CONT'D)
And I will make you proud. Loki 
savors the moment, but it's short-
lived, as Thor bursts in. He's 
thrown by the scene before him -- 
Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns 
dead, Frigga regarding Loki with 
pride and respect. Stunned and 
delighted to see Thor, Frigga 
beams.

FRIGGA
Thor!

She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed 
on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

LOKI
Found its way back to you, did it?

THOR
No thanks to you. Frigga picks up 
on the tension building between her 
sons.

FRIGGA
What?

THOR
Why don't you tell her? How you 
sent the Destroyer to kill our 
friends? To kill me? Frigga looks 
to Loki, alarmed and confused.

LOKI
It must have been enforcing 
Father's last command.

THOR
You're a talented liar, brother. 
Always have been.

LOKI
(SMILES)
It's good to have you back.

(DEAD SERIOUS)
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to 
destroy Jotunheim. Loki suddenly

backwards, SMASHING through the 
chamber walls, into...

Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of 
the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in 
an enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

LOKI
All these years, and no one's ever 
dared to use it as a weapon. Thor 
hurries to the ice, raises his 
hammer to SMASH through it to get 
to the controls frozen within. 
Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. 
The blast hits the ice in front of 
Thor, blasting him back across the 
floor. Loki steps down from the ice 
as Thor staggers to his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
You can't stop it. The Bifrost will 
build until it rips Jotunheim 
apart.

THOR
Why have you done this?

LOKI
To do what Father never could. To 
destroy their kind forever. When he 
awakens, he'll see the wisdom of 
what I've done.

THOR
He won't! You can't kill an entire 
race!

LOKI
What is this newfound love for the 
Frost Giants? You, who would have 
killed them all with your bare 
hands.

THOR
I've changed.

LOKI
So have I.

Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Fight me.

131.


He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his 
hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, 
but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back 
towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims 
Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the 
air. He hangs there, suspended.

THOR
Is the throne really worth what 
you've done? What you would become?

LOKI
I never wanted the throne. I only 
wanted to be your equal. Now fight 
me!

With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. 
Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

THOR
I will not fight you, brother.

LOKI
I am not your brother. I never was.

THOR
Loki, this is madness... Loki 
grins.

LOKI
Is it?

He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to 
his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
What happened to you on earth that 
turned you so soft? Don't tell me 
it was a woman.

Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

LOKI (CONT'D)
It was. Perhaps when we're finished 
here I'll pay her a little visit 
myself.

That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and 
their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing 
years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice 
but to defend himself.

Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending 
Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his 
hand. The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. 
Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it 
back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is 
too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor 
himself slides towards the Bifrost.

LOKI
If you care so much for the Jotuns, 
then die with them. The Bifrost 
stretches every cell of Thor's 
body, trying to drag him away. He's 
nearly swallowed by the vortex, 
when he concentrates, mustering his 
will. He reaches out his hand 
towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies 
back through the maelstrom, into 
Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him 
free. Loki tries to fire off 
another blast at him, but Thor 
takes to the air, speeds towards 
his brother.

Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and

Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking 
up at him desperately.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Please...

Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his 
brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just 
then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls 
around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki 
lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him 
across the bridge.

Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind 
him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around. It 
passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next to 
him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion. 
Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, 
never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The 
Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

LOKIS
I was always more clever than you.

THOR
Yet still not clever enough. With 
that, Thor raises his hammer, 
rising into the air, summoning 
lightning. A massive bolt strikes 
Mjolnir, then channels outwards, 
splitting up, striking each one of 
the Lokis.

All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real 
Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir 
knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen 
brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for 
the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries 
to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the 
problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he 
may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor 
looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards 
Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy 
moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. 
Loki watches him smugly.

LOKI
Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With 
all your strength, what good does 
it do you now? Thor knows Loki's 
right. He's powerless to stop 
what's happening.

He looks down at the Bridge beneath 
his feet, VIBRATING from the force 
and speed of the Bifrost energy 
feeding into the Observatory. Then 
he gets an idea. He realizes what 
he must do -- and what he must 
sacrifice. Thor extends his hand 
towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. 
The hammer goes flying to his 
grasp. Loki looks confused.

Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him, 
thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he 
channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes 
Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is massive, 
causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the 
Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears where 
the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Stop! What are you doing?! Thor 
lifts the hammer again, brings it 
down harder. BOOM! The crack grows 
bigger. The Bifrost energy starts 
to stream out from it. Loki thinks 
fast.

LOKI (CONT'D)
If you destroy the Bridge, you'll 
never see her again! Loki grabs 
Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to 
pierce Thor through the back.

THOR
Forgive me.

Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises 
Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all 
sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- 
KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING 
out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the 
force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward 
along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart 
as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and 
Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, 
while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards 
the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the 
broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the 
destructive force of the energy, carried away by the 
current, pulverized by the debris, when --

A POWERFUL HAND

Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir 
as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

SEE --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Standing on the edge of the broken 
Bridge, awakened from the 
Odinsleep, restored to his full 
strength. Loki searches his 
father's face, looking for some 
kind of approval, some kind of 
redemption, but all he sees is 
disappointment and regret. Loki 
lets go.

THOR
No!

But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki 
falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries 
him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the 
Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up 
onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's 
arms.

ODIN
It is over.

BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
159
159

The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing 
in all directions. Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand 
watching in amazement. Jane looks back up at the sky, 
distraught. She knows the significance of what's just 
happened.

JANE
It's gone.

INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160
160
160

A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three 
sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between 
Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting 
their battle with the Destroyer.

VOLSTAGG
...and then, with a mighty bellow, 
I flew at the great metal beast and 
laid it low...

136.


FANDRAL
Is that another way of saying you 
fell on your huge a--

VOLSTAGG
As a matter of fact, falling down 
was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer 
into a false sense of security!

FANDRAL
Well, I was the one who had to drag 
your enormous carcass off the 
battlefield. That makes me the real 
hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun 
points to Volstagg.

HOGUN
Big stomach.
(points to Fandral)
Big mouth.

The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral 
look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a 
smile.

FANDRAL
Well, how about that? A smile! I'd 
say that calls for another drink!

They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost 
in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to 
conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.

SIF
My Queen. I am so sorry for your 
loss.

Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

FRIGGA
Thank you, Sif.

She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment 
around him.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
How is he?

SIF
He mourns for his brother. And he 
misses her. The mortal.

Frigga sees the trace of regret in 
Sif's face as she looks at Thor 
with new feelings. He rises and 
leaves the hall.

FRIGGA
He will need his friends now more 
than ever.

SIF
I will always be at his side. 
Frigga understands, puts her arm 
around Sif gratefully.

EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161
161
161

Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin 
walks up behind him.

ODIN
You'll be a wise King.

THOR
There will never be a wiser king 
than you. Or a better father.

(THEN)
I have much to learn. I know that 
now. But some day, perhaps, I will 
make you proud.

ODIN
You've already made me proud. Odin 
leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162
162
162

Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost 
energy, drifting off into space. Thor walks out to its edge, 
where Heimdall stands watch. Thor stares out at the stellar 
void.

THOR
Can you see her? Heimdall turns, 
gazes out towards Earth.

HEIMDALL
Yes.

THOR
How is she?

SIF (CONT'D)

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163
163
163

Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged 
ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull 
away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program 
clearly inspired by the illustration. We pull further back 
to see that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded 
research facility, abuzz with activity. SHIELD SCIENTISTS 
and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of- the-art 
equipment. Selvig orchestrates the process, giving 
instructions to the SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right 
outside the glass windows and rise up to find Jane sitting 
at the front of the roof, working at a small, improvised 
workstation, notebook at hand, as always. She sets up an 
impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE before her, which bears the 
"STARK INDUSTRIES"¬ù logo. From behind, Darcy approaches, 
hands her a flash drive.

DARCY
Here you go.

JANE
Thanks.

Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

DARCY
He would have come back if he 
could.

JANE
I know. But if he can't get here on 
his own...

Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D 
HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, 
bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is -- 
YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

JANE (CONT'D)
...maybe we can help him find his 
way back.
