EXT. UNKNOWN AREA OF SPACE

Space, a floating staircase among the rocks...THE OTHER
speaks to a DISEMBODIED FIGURE in a chair.

THE OTHER (V.O)
The Tesseract has awakened. It is
on a little world, a human world.
They would wield its power.

THE OTHER hands LOKI a scepter with a glowing blue gem...

THE OTHER (V.O)
But our ally knows its workings as
they never will. He is ready to
lead. And our force...

The CHITAURI put on their face mask and get ready.

THE OTHER (V.O)
...our Chitauri, will follow. The
world will be his...the universe,
yours. And the humans, what can
they do but burn?

A 3d model of the Tesseract, we move inside it slowly

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - EARLY NIGHT

A helicopter SPEEDS over this mountain at high-speed. The
CAMERA pans up over the mountain and we see...

EXT. SHIELD/NASA FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

This base is grand beyond belief. There is a frantic
evacuation in progress. AGENTS, SCIENTISTS, and PERSONNEL
rush around the base frantically.

INTERCOM VOICE
All personnel, evacuation order has
been confirmed. Proceed to your
designated vehicles...

A man flushes people by. The sign on the building reads:

JOINT DARK ENERGY MISSION; WESTERN DIVISION; PROJECT
PEGASUS, NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, S.H.I.E.L.D
ACCELERATOR TEST FACILITY

INTERCOM VOICE
...for all campus evacuation.

Security Guards direct traffic. SHIELD agents assist people,
some stuff the trunks of their cars and leave the campus.

INTERCOM VOICE (CONT’D)
This is not a drill. Emergency
personnel proceed to your
designated vehicles for all campus
evacuation.

The helicopter slows above a-

There is a man in suit waiting. This is AGENT PHIL COULSON.

ON THE CHOPPER: The door slides open. Out comes a female,
this is AGENT MARIA HILL. Following behind her is NICK FURY.

Fury and Hill walk over to Coulson.

FURY
How bad is it?

AGENT COULSON
That’s the problem, sir. We don’t
know.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER (EARLY NIGHT)

An elevator rushes down. It’s going fast.

AGENT COULSON (V.O)
Doctor Selvig read an...

Coulson, Fury, and Hill make their way through the crowds of
evacuating personnel.

AGENT COULSON
...energy surge from the Tesseract
four hours ago.

FURY
NASA didn’t authorize Selvig could
go to test B.

AGENT COULSON
He wasn’t testing it. He wasn’t
even in the room. Spontaneous
event.

MARIA HILL
It just turned itself on?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

FURY
Where are the energy levels now?

AGENT COULSON
Climbing. When Selvig couldn’t shut
it down we ordered evac.

FURY
How long to get everyone out?

AGENT COULSON
Campus should be clear in the next
half hour.

FURY
Do better.

Fury and Hill continue on as Coulson turns around and heads
the other way.

7
INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER (EARLY NIGHT)
7

Fury and Hill make their way down to the lower levels.

MARIA HILL
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

FURY
We should tell them to go back to
sleep?

MARIA HILL
If we can’t control the Tesseract’s
energy there may not be a minimum
safe distance.

FURY
I need you to make sure the Phase
Two prototypes are shipped out.

MARIA HILL
Sir, is that really a priority
right now?

FURY
Until such time as the world ends
we will act as though it intends to
spin on. Clear out the tech below.
Every piece of Phase Two on a truck
and gone.

MARIA HILL
Yes, Sir.
(to guards)
With me.

Fury enters the Tesseract room.

INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS (EARLY NIGHT)

Fury makes his way over to ERIK SELVIG.

FURY
Talk to me, Doctor.

SELVIG
Director.

FURY
Is there anything we know for
certain?

SELVIG
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

FURY
Is that supposed to be funny?

SELVIG
No, it’s not funny at all. The
Tesseract is not only active, she’s
misbehaving.

FURY
How soon can you pull the plug?

SELVIG
She’s an energy source. We turn off
the power, she turns it back on. If
she reaches peak level-

FURY
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

SELVIG
We don’t have the harness. My
calculations are far from complete.
She’s throwing off interference,
radiation. Nothing harmful, low
levels of Gamma radiation.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

FURY
That can be harmful. Where’s agent
Barton?

SELVIG
The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.

CLINT BARTON, also known as HAWKEYE, is on a balcony,
observing the lab.

FURY
(over Barton’s radio)
Agent Barton. Report.

Barton zip-lines down a rope.

FURY (V.O)
(sturn)
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.

Fury and Barton walk together toward the Tesseract machine.

BARTON
I see better from a distance.

FURY
Have you seen anything that might
set this thing off?

A NASA SCIENTIST calls for Selvig.

NASA SCIENTIST
Doctor! It’s spiking again.

Barton and Fury step onto the platform, in front of the
Tesseract machine.

BARTON
No one’s come and gone. And
Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM.
If there’s any tampering, sir, it
wasn’t this end.

While Barton is talking Selvig walks over to the computer
where the NASA SCIENTIST is. He looks concerned and worried.

FURY
(a little confused)
At this end?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

BARTON
Yeah. The Cube is a doorway to the
other end of space, right?
Doors
open from both sides.

The Cube sparks.

SELVIG
What’s that?

It sparks again.

EXT. BEHIND A TRUCK - SAME (EARLY NIGHT)

Coulson stands. The grounds of the campus shakes. He grabs
the truck.

10
INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - SAME
10

Hill turns and looks around her, hearing a creaking noise as
the building shakes.

11
INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
11

The Cube sparks some more, bigger each time. A beam of
energy which opens into a portal. There is an explosion.

A could from the beam floats to the top of the chamber. On
the platform is LOKI, God of Mischief and Lies, kneeling.
Several GUARDS move in slowly.

TIGHT ON LOKI: He looks up, grinning menacingly. She stands.

DOLLY IN: Fury and Barton stare in shock.

ON SELVIG: He is in awe and horror.

Loki looks around. Fury is ready to act.

FURY
(to Loki)
Sir, please put down the spear!

Loki looks at his scepter then fires a stream on blue light
from it. Barton pushes Fury out the way. The guards open
fire. Loki jumps at them, firing more energy and fighting.
Shooting scientists and agents. Barton moves towards him but
Loki grabs his arm.

LOKI
You have heart.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
7.

Loki touches the tip of the spear to Barton’s chest and his
eyes become ice blue. He puts his gun away. Loki moves to
another agent and does the same as he’s done to Barton.

Fury pulls the Cube from the machine it was in and shuts it
in a briefcase, then moves to leave.

LOKI
(to Fury, turning around)
Please don’t. I still need that.

FURY
This doesn’t have to get any
messier.

LOKI
Of course it does. I’ve come too
far for anything else. I am Loki,
of Asgard. And I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

Selvig, checking the pulse of NASA SCIENTIST, hears and
approaches.

SELVIG
Loki, brother of Thor?

FURY
We have no quarrel with your
people.

LOKI
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

FURY
You planning to step on us?

LOKI
I come with glad tidings, of a
world made free.

FURY
Free from what?

LOKI
Freedom. Freedom is life’s great
lie. Once you accept that, in your
heart-

Loki turns and places the spear tip on Selvig’s chest.
-you will know peace.

Barton sees the Tesseract portal cloud, brewing and moves to
Loki.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)
8.

FURY
Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think
you mean the other thing.

BARTON
(to Loki)
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow and
drop a hundred feet of rock on us.
He means to bury us.

FURY
Like the pharaohs of old.

SELVIG
He’s right. The portal is
collapsing in on itself. We’ve got
maybe two minutes before this goes
critical.

LOKI
Well then.

Barton quickly draws his gun and shoots Fury, who drops the
case. Barton picks up as he, Loki, Selvig and another agent
leave the room.

12
INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - A FEW SHORT MOMENTS LATER
12

Barton and the others walk under the closing gate. Hill
comes out from the back room.

BARTON
We need this vehicles.

MARIA HILL
(seeing Loki)
Who’s that?

BARTON
Didn’t tell me.

The roof is slowly crumbling. Loki gets onto a SHIELD pickup
truck. Selvig enters the passenger seat, holding the case.

FURY
(over Hill’s radio)
Hill!

back room wall and returns fire. Barton enters the driver’s
seat of the pickup and drives off with Loki is in the bed.

Hill throws her radio into the front seat of a SHIELD jeep.
She jumps in after and speeds away, trying to catch up with
Barton.

17
INT. DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

SHIELD cars are chasing Barton’s pickup. Loki fires a beam
from his spear, flipping the car over on its head --
blocking the pursuing vehicles and fleeing cars.

The portal begins to collapse as Fury tries to escape.
Falling debris misses him by a few inches.

19
INT. FRONT STEPS OF A BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
19

Coulson is assisting evacuation, supervising guards as the
wheel crates. An explosion rocks the building. They all fall
as the roof dissolves faster. The four guards try to pick up
the case-

AGENT COULSON
(to guards)
Let’s just go. No-no-no! Leave it,
leave it. GO!

INT. DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Barton speeds up because he’s coming up on an intersection.
Hill comes speeding out of the right tunnel, she spins the
jeep around -- coming face to face with Barton, who shoots
through his window. Hill returns fire -- firing through the
windshield.

21
INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Coulson and the guards climb into the canopy of the truck.

AGENT COULSON

Fury runs through the front door of a building and into...

AGENT COULSON (V.O)
(over Fury’s radio)
...We need to go.

The last waiting chopper, which takes off as the ground
beneath begins to crack up.

23
INT. DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Barton fires at Hill one more time. She fires back, finally
Barton gets the upper hand and swings in front of Hill --
cutting her off. She turns he jeep around and continues to
speed behind them.

The entire base explodes and crumbles in on itself --
sinking into the underground. Fury watches in horror from
his chopper window.


11.

27
DIMLY LIT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
27

The ceiling of the tunnel falls, trapping Hill and other
agents underground. Loki looks at the exit to see if they
will make it out.

28
INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
28

Coulson and the others in the canopy stare at the ground
behind their truck -- the ground is still collapsing,
seconds behind there vehicle, they get away in time.

29
EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
29

Loki and the others escape the tunnel seconds before the
exit is covered up by the fallen ceiling. As they drive
along, Fury’s chopper chases them. Barton drives frantically
as Fury shoots at them from the sky.

Loki blasts the helicopter and Fury jumps to the ground as
it crashes, he continues to fire as the truck drives off in
the distance. He stands.

AGENT COULSON

Director Fury, do you copy?

FURY
(into radio)
The Tesseract is with a hostile
force. I have men down. Hill?

MARIA HILL
(into radio; getting out of
crushed jeep)
A lot of men still under. Don’t
know how many survivors.

FURY
(over Hill’s radio)
Sound a general call. I want every
living soul...

This is a level seven.

FURY
(over Hill’s radio)
As of right now...

FURY
(into his radio)
We are at war.

AGENT COULSON
(into his radio)
What do we do?

Fury thinks, as the CAMERA GOES TIGHT on him.

EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE, RUSSIA - NIGHT
30

A train speeds by. CAMERA PULLS through the warehouse window
and MOVES UP to the third floor where NATASHA ROMANOFF aka
BLACK WIDOW, is tied to a chair. A man slaps her. She
screams.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
This isn’t how I wanted this
evening to go.

NATASHA
(in Russian)
I know how you wanted this evening.
Believe me this is better.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
Who are you working for? Lermentov,
yes?

TALL THUG walks over to Natasha and leans the chair over a
pit. She becomes scared.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

GEORGI LUCHKOV (CONT’D)
(in Russian)
Does he think we have to go through
him to move our cargo?

NATASHA
(in Russian)
I thought General Solohob is in
charge of the export business.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your
outdated information betrays you.
The famous Black Widow is just
another pretty face.

NATASHA
(in Russian)
You really think I’m pretty?

TALL THUG grabs her jaw and forces it open as Luchkov walks
to the table behind him.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to
move the tanks. Tell him he is out.
Well...

Luchkov picks up a tool of the table and plays with it.
...You may have to write it.

Suddenly a phone rings. WEASELLY THUG answers his phone.

WEASELLY THUG
It’s for her.

Luchkov takes the phone.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian; into cell)
You listen carefully-

AGENT COULSON (V.O)
(over the cell)
You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd
floor. We have an F-22 exactly
eight miles out. Put the woman on
the phone or I will blow up the
block before you can make the
lobby.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

Luchkov hands the phone to Natasha, who balances it on her
shoulder.
(over the cell)
We need you to come in.

NATASHA
(into cell)
Are you kidding? I’m working.

AGENT COULSON
(over the cell)
This takes precedence.

NATASHA
(into cell)
I’m in the middle of an
interrogation, and this moron is
giving me everything.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(to Tall Thug)
I not- give everything.

Natasha gives Luchkov a look.

BEGIN INTERCUT: COULSON / NATASHA

NATASHA
(into cell)
Look, you can’t pull me out of this
right now.

AGENT COULSON
(into cell)
Natasha...Barton’s been
compromised.

NATASHA
(into cell)
Let me put you on hold.

Luchkov moves in for the cell phone. Natasha kicks him
between the legs and headbutts him. WEASELLY THUG swings his
fist at her and she kicks him back. TALL THUG runs up and
she spins around -- and the chair legs hit him.

WEASELLY THUG jumps to his feet. Natasha rolls with the
chair and drops the legs on his feet. She whips her head at
him and hits him in the nose then trips him.

As she fights the TALL THUG, Coulson listens to the fight
over the phone. He stands quiet -- waiting as he hears the
groaning, kicking, and punching.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (4)
15.

Natasha spring boards off TALL THUG’s back, somersaults, and
breaks the chair on WEASELLY THUG. TALL THUG grabs her and
Natasha bends his hand then hits him with the chair leg. She
does a front dropkick against TALL THUG then pushes herself
off the ground with both hands.

She runs toward TALL THUG, who is out of breath, and flips
him with her thighs. Luchkov stands and she swiftly walks
over to the chain hanging from the ceiling. As he approaches
she hits him with it, wraps one leg in it, and throws him
into the pit. She leaves him upside down and picks up the
cell and her high heels.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
(into cell)
Where’s Barton now?

AGENT COULSON
(over cell)
We don’t know.

NATASHA
But he’s alive?

AGENT COULSON
(into phone)
We think so.

Coulson is looking at a screen that’s playing a video of
Hawkeye & Black Widow in Budapest.
We’ll brief you on everything when
you get back.

Coulson is handed a folder. He walks down some stairs as he
talks.
But first, we need you to talk to
the big guy.

NATASHA
(into cell)
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.

AGENT COULSON
Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big
guy.

END INTERCUT

Natasha stops in her tracks, shocked at what Coulson has
just said.

EXT. SLUMS, CALCUTTA, INDIA - NIGHT

A YOUNG GIRL sprints across a busy street. She runs through
a crowd of people, rushing down an busy alleyway. She runs
into a house and up the stairs.

CALCUTTA WOMAN approaches her. BRUCE BANNER, the alter ego
of the Incredible Hulk, is treating the ill in the b.g.

CALCUTTA WOMAN
(in Hindi)
Who are you? Get out! There is
sickness here!

YOUNG GIRL
(very fast in Hindi)
Are you the doctor? I need a
doctor. My father. My father’s not
waking up! He has a fever and he’s
moaning but his eyes won’t open.

Banner hears and moves over to the YOUNG GIRL. He kneels
before her.

BANNER
(in Hindi)
Slow down.

YOUNG GIRL
(in Hindi)
My father-

BANNER
(in Hindi)
Like them?

Banner points to the people in the house that are sick.
YOUNG GIRL nods and holds up a wad of cash.

YOUNG GIRL
(in Hindi; emotion)
Please!

YOUNG GIRL is rushing to reach the shack but Banner, a
little suspicious, grabs her -- slowing her down. A truck
drives by very slow, Banner glances at it as it passes.

Banner and the girl rush across the dirt road. The YOUNG
GIRL sprints into the shack and Banner follows slowly.

Banner enters in time to see her escape through the window.
He’s been ditched and he realizes he’s been set up.

BANNER
(quietly to himself)
Should have got paid upfront
Banner.

NATASHA
You know, for a man who’s supposed
to be...

Natasha reveals herself to Banner from behind a curtain.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
...avoiding stress, you picked a
hell of a place to settle.

BANNER
(putting his bag down)
Avoiding stress isn’t the secret.

NATASHA
Then what is it? Yoga?

BANNER
And you brought me to the end of
the city. Smart.
(peeping through the window)
I- uh- I assume the whole place is
surrounded.

Natasha removes her scarf.

NATASHA
Just you and me.

BANNER
And your actress buddy? She a spy
too, they start that wrong?

NATASHA
(a little nervous)
I did.

BANNER
Who are you?

NATASHA
Natasha Romanoff.

BANNER
Are you here to kill me, Ms
Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going
to work out for everyone.

NATASHA
No, no. Of course not. I’m here on
behalf of SHIELD.

BANNER
(a little mad)
SHIELD. How’d they find me?

NATASHA
We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve
kept our distance, even helped keep
some other interested parties off
your scent.

BANNER
Why?

NATASHA
Nick Fury seems to trust you. But
now we need you to come in.

BANNER
What if I say no?

NATASHA
(seductive, sturn, smiling)
I’ll persuade you.

BANNER
(a little sad and reluctant)
And what if the- Other Guy says no?

NATASHA
You’ve been more than a year
without an incident. I don’t think
you want to break that streak.

Banner pushes at an old wooden cradle, it creaks.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

BANNER
Well, I don’t every time get what I
want.

NATASHA
Doctor, we’re facing a potential
global catastrophe.

BANNER
(chuckles)
Oh those I actively try to avoid.

NATASHA
This (takes a seat) is the
Tesseract.

Natasha slides a cell phone along the table. On it is an
image of the Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe
out the planet.

Banner puts on his glasses, approaches and picks up the
touch screen cell phone.

BANNER
What does Fury want me to do?
Swallow it?

NATASHA
He wants you to find it. It’s been
taken. It emits a Gamma signature
that’s too weak for us to trace. No
one knows Gamma radiation like you
do. If there was, that’s where I’d
be.

BANNER
So Fury isn’t after the monster?

NATASHA
Not that he’s told me.

BANNER
And he tells you everything?

NATASHA
Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

BANNER
(immediate response)
He needs me in a cage?

NATASHA
No one’s going to put you in a-

BANNER
STOP LYING TO ME!

Banner yells, crashing his hands down on the table. Natasha
stands, pulling a gun and aims at him. He draws back,
smiling.
I’m sorry. That was mean. (smiles)
I just wanted to see what you’d do.

Natasha stares at him, a little teary, scared out of her
mind.
Why don’t we do this the easy way
where you don’t use that and the-
Other Guy doesn’t make a mess?
Okay?....Natasha.

Natasha lowers her weapon and speaks into an earpiece.

NATASHA
(quietly into her earpiece)
Stand down. We’re good here.

The horde of armed guards surrounding the shack lower their
weapons.

BANNER
Just you and me?

Natasha realizes he knows and stands silent.

INT. DARK ROOM, CARRIER - NIGHT

Fury is talking with the Council, four shadowy figures on
screens.

COUNCILMAN
This is out of line, Director.
You’re dealing with forces you
can’t control.

FURY
You ever been in a war, councilman?
In a fire fight? Did you feel an
over abundance of control?

COUNCILMAN
You’re saying that this Asgard is
declaring war on our planet?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
21.

FURY
Not Asgard, Loki.

COUNCILWOMAN
He can’t be working alone. What
about the other one, his brother?

FURY
Our intelligence says Thor is not a
hostile. But he’s worlds away and
we can’t depend on him to help
either. It’s up to us.

COUNCILMAN
Which is why you should be focusing
on Phase Two, it was designed for
exactly this purpose.

FURY
Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy
is. We need a response team.

COUNCILMAN
The Avengers Initiative was shut
down.

FURY
This isn’t about the Avengers.

COUNCILMAN
We’re running the world’s greatest
covert security network and you’re
gonna leave the fate of the human
race to a handful of freaks.

FURY
I’m not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team. These
people may be isolated, unbalanced
even, but I believe, with the right
push, they can be exactly what we
need.

COUNCILWOMAN
You believe!

COUNCILMAN
War isn’t won by sentiment,
Director.

FURY
No, It’s won by soldiers.

INT. GYM - NIGHT

STEVE ROGERS, alter ego of Captain America, is hitting a
punching bag in a gym. He has several flashbacks of World
War Two. During his flashbacks...

CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O)
There’s not enough time. I gotta
put her in the water.

...he hits the bag harder, faster...

PEGGY CARTER (V.O)
You won’t be alone.

...he hits the bag even faster.

SCIENTIST (V.O)
Oh my God. This guy’s still alive.

Steve throws the hardest punch he has left and it knocks the
bag across the room. Breathing hard, Steve picks up another
bag from a line on the floor and hangs it up. He begins to
hit it. And-

FURY
(across the room)
Trouble sleeping?

STEVE
(hitting the bag)
Slept for seventy years, Sir. I
think I’ve had my fill.

Fury slowly approaches Steve.

FURY
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

STEVE
When I went under, the world was at
war. I wake up- they say we won.
They didn’t say what we lost.

FURY
We’ve made some mistakes along the
way, some very recently.

STEVE
(removing hand wrap)
You here with a mission, Sir?

FURY
I am.

STEVE
(removing other hand wrap)
Trying to get me back in the world?

FURY
Trying to save it.

Fury hands Steve a folder with information on the Tesseract
in it.

STEVE
HYDRA’s secret weapon.

FURY
Howard Stark fished that out of the
ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think. The
Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That’s something the world sorely
needs.

STEVE
Who took it from you?

FURY
He’s called Loki. He’s- not from
around here. There’s a lot we’ll
have to bring you up to speed on if
you’re in. The world has gotten
even stranger than you already
know.

STEVE
At this point I doubt anything
would surprise me.

Steve gets up, grabs his duffel bag, and another punching
bag while Fury is talking.

FURY
Ten bucks says you’re wrong.
There’s a debriefing packet waiting
for you back at your apartment. Is
there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought
to know now?

IRON MAN aka Tony Stark, is underwater. He attaches a device

the city and begins talking with PEPPER POTTS.

IRON MAN
Good to go on this end. The rest is
up to you.

PEPPER (V.O)

You disconnected the transmission
lines? Are we off the grid?

INSIDE IRON MAN HEADSET:

TONY

PEPPER

We’ve got to go wider on the public
awareness campaign. You need to do
some press.

Iron Man flies over a overpass & up the side of Stark Tower.

PEPPER (V.O)
(over Iron Man headset)
I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on
the zoning for the next three

Iron Man lands on the landing pad of the tower and walks

JARVIS
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on

Pepper stands in front of a holographic display, a little
confused.

PEPPER
Levels are holding steady- I think.

Tony approaches Pepper.

TONY
Of course they are, I was directly
involved. Which leads me to my next
question. How does it feel to be a
genius?

Tony turns off the display and Pepper and he face each
other.

PEPPER
Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know
now would I?

TONY
What do you mean? All this came
from you.

PEPPER
No, all this came from that.

Pepper taps Tony’s arc reactor.

TONY
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower is your baby. Give
yourself- twelve percent of the
credit.

PEPPER
Twelve percent?
TONY
An argument can be made for
fifteen.

Pepper walks toward the living room.

PEPPER
Twelve percent of my baby?

TONY

Well, I did do all the heavy
lifting. Literally, I lifted the
heavy things and sorry but, the
security snafu? That was on you.

PEPPER
Oh!

TONY

Pepper pours champagne in two glasses.

PEPPER
You mean our elevator.

TONY
Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty
workmen. I’m going to pay for that
comment about percentages in some
subtle way later aren’t I?

PEPPER
Not gonna be that subtle.

TONY
I’ll tell you what, next building
is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower.

PEPPER
On the lease!

TONY
Call your mum, can you bunk over?

JARVIS
Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my
protocols are being overridden.

TONY
Ah-

Tony picks up his high-tech phone and holds up.

AGENT COULSON
(on phone screen)
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

TONY
You have reached the Life Model
Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a
message.

AGENT COULSON

This is urgent.

That’s on you!

PEPPER
Phil! Come in!

Pepper and Tony walk over to Coulson, who is entering

TONY
Phil?

AGENT COULSON
I can’t stay.

TONY
Uh, his first name is Agent.

PEPPER
Come on in, we’re celebrating.

TONY
(fake smiling)
Which is why he can’t stay.

AGENT COULSON
(handing Tony the laptop)
We need you to look this over, as
soon as possible.

Tony stares at the laptop.

TONY
I don’t like being handed things.

PEPPER
That’s fine because I love to be
handed things. So, let’s trade.

Pepper swaps with Coulson -- he has with her glass and she
has the laptop. She then takes Tony’s glass and passes the
laptop on to him.
Thank you.

TONY

Thursday.

AGENT COULSON
This isn’t a consultation.

PEPPER
Is this about the Avengers?

Coulson looks at Pepper
Which I know nothing about.

TONY
The Avengers Initiative was
scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t
even qualify.

PEPPER
I didn’t know that either.

TONY
Yeah, apparently I’m volatile,
self-obsessed, don’t play well with
others.

PEPPER
That I did know.

AGENT COULSON
This isn’t about personality
profiles anymore.

TONY
Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec?

PEPPER
Half a moment.

Pepper leaves Coulson at the door and goes over to Tony.

TONY
You know, I thought we were having
a moment.

PEPPER
I was having twelve percent of a
moment.

Tony gives Pepper a look.
This seems serious. Phil looks
pretty shaken.

TONY
How would you notice- why is he
Phil?

PEPPER

TONY
This is- ah...

Tony grabs the holograms on the laptop and throws them up.
Holograms fill the room, each is a article on one of the
Avengers.
...this!

They both look upon the screens, observing them.

PEPPER
I’m going to take the jet to DC
tonight.

TONY
Tomorrow.

PEPPER
You have homework. You have a lot
of homework.

TONY
Well, what if I didn’t?

PEPPER
If you didn’t? You mean when you
finished? Well, um, then-

She leans in and whispers in Tony’s ear.

TONY
Square deal. Fly safe.

They kiss. Coulson looks away.

PEPPER
Work hard.
(approaching Coulson)
So, any chance you’re driving by
LaGuardia?

AGENT COULSON
I can drop you off.

PEPPER (O.S)
Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear
about the ah- cellist, is that
still a thing?

As they are talking, Tony sees the Tesseract -- It peaks his
interest.

Coulson stands from a chair and walks over to Steve.

STEVE
So, this Doctor Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on
me?

AGENT COULSON
A lot of people were. You were the
world’s first superhero. Banner
thought Gamma radiation might hold
the key to unlocking Erskine’s
original formula.

STEVE
Didn’t really go his way, did it?

AGENT COULSON
Not so much. When he’s not that
thing though, guy’s like a Stephen
Hawking.

Rogers looks confused.
He’s like a- smart person. I gotta
say- it’s an honor to meet you,
officially. I sort of met you, I
mean, I watched you while you were
sleeping. I mean, I was, I was
present, while you were unconscious

job.

AGENT COULSON
Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made
some modifications to the uniform.
I had a little design input.

STEVE
The uniform? Aren’t the stars and
stripes a little...old-fashioned?

Tesseract will unveil.

LOKI
You don’t have the Tesseract yet.

The Chitauri creature lunges at Loki, hissing.
I don’t threaten. But until I open
the doors, until your force is mine
to command, you are but words.

THE OTHER
You will have your war, Asgardian.
If you fail, if the Tesseract is
kept from us, there will be no

NATASHA
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice. Thought
Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask
you to sign his Captain America
trading cards yet?

STEVE
Trading cards?

NATASHA
They’re vintage. He’s very proud.

They see Banner who is bumping into people while he observes
the carrier.

STEVE
Doctor Banner.

BANNER
Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be
coming.

STEVE
Word is you can find the Cube.

BANNER
Is that the only word on me?

STEVE
Only word I care about.

BANNER
Must be strange for you, all of

BANNER

Oh no, this is much worse.

Banner shakes Fury’s hand.

BANNER
Thanks for asking nicely. So, um,
how long am I staying?

FURY
Once we get our hands on the
Tesseract, you’re in the wind.

BANNER
Well where are you with that?

AGENT COULSON
We’re sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones...

Steve stands in the b.g. confused of what’s being said.
While Coulson is talking, Natasha moves over to a computer
screen where we see Barton’s face trace in progress. She
checks the stats.
...laptops, if it’s connected to a
satellite, it’s eyes and ears for
us.

NATASHA
It’s still not gonna find them in

You have to narrow your field. How
many Spectrometers do you have
access to?

FURY
How many are there?

BANNER
Call every lab you know. Tell them
to put the Spectrometers on the
roof and calibrate them for Gamma
rays. I’ll rough out a tracking
algorithm, basic cluster
recognition. At least we could rule
out a few places. Do you have
somewhere for me to work?

FURY
Agent Romanoff, would you show
Doctor Banner to his laboratory,
please?

Natasha walks over to Banner and they begin walking out of
the bridge area.

NATASHA
You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got
all the toys.

NATASHA
I’m not sure-

BANNER

Oh you’re very young.

Fury walks up to Hill.

Hill, did you tell the council that
Barton had been compromised?

BARTON
SHIELD has no shortage of enemies,
Doctor. This the stuff you need?

SELVIG
Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in
meteorites, it forms anti-protons.
It’s very hard to get hold of.

BARTON
Especially if SHIELD knows you need
it.

SELVIG
Well, I didn’t know.

Loki walks up.

Hey! This is wonderful. The
Tesseract has shown me so much.
It’s- it’s more than knowledge,
it’s truth.

LOKI
I know. It, ah- it touches everyone

Selvig walks back to the machine he was working on.

LOKI
I see why Fury chose you to guard
it.

BARTON
You’re going to have to contend
with him sir. As long as he’s in
the air, I can’t pin him down. And
he’ll be putting together a team.

LOKI
Are they a threat?

BARTON
To each other more than likely. But
if Fury can get ’em on track, and
he might, they could throw some
noise our way.

LOKI
You admire Fury.

BARTON
He’s got a clear line of sight.

LOKI
Is that why you failed to kill him?

BARTON
It might be. I was disoriented, and
I’m not at my best with a gun.

LOKI
I want to know everything you can
tell me about this team of his. I
would- test their mettle.

Barton nods.
I am weary of scuttling in shadow.

Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL!

The people hurry, dropping to their knees.
(walking through the mob)
Is not this simpler? Is this not
your natural state? It’s the
unspoken truth of humanity, that
you crave subjugation. The bright
lure of freedom diminishes your
life’s joy in a mad scramble for
power, for identity. You were made-

That guy’s a friendly.

NATASHA
Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki,
or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.

Iron Man begins walking to the edge of the ramp.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, we need a plan of attack.

IRON MAN
I have a plan. Attack!

Iron Man flies out of the jet and Cap makes for a parachute.

NATASHA
I’d sit this one out, Cap.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
I don’t see how I can.

NATASHA
These guys come from legend,
they’re basically Gods.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m
pretty sure he doesn’t dress like
that.

Cap straps on the chute, grabs his shield, and dives out the
plane, head first.

EXT. CLIFF TOP - NIGHT

Thor and Loki crash down on a cliff. Thor throws Loki to the
ground, he groans.

THOR
Where is the Tesseract?

LOKI
Oh-ho, I missed you too.

THOR
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

LOKI
Oh, you should thank me. With the
Bifrost gone, how many dark energy
did the All-Father
have to muster
to conjure you here? Your precious
Earth.

Thor drops his hammer, Mjolnir, and pulls Loki to his feet.

THOR
I thought you dead.

LOKI
Did you mourn?

THOR
We all did. Our father-

LOKI
Your father. He did tell you my
true parentage, did he not?

THOR
We were raised together, we played
together, we fought together. Do
you remember none of that?

LOKI
I remember a shadow, living in the
shade of your greatness. I remember
you tossing me
into an abyss. I
who was and should be king!

THOR
So you take the world I love as
recompense for your imagined
slights? No. The Earth is under my
protection, Loki.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
48.

LOKI
Well yes.

THOR
Then you miss the truth of ruling,
brother. Throne would suit you ill.

Loki pushes past Thor and walks away, Thor follows.

LOKI
I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known
about. I have grown, Odinson, in my
exile. I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract, and when I wield
it-

THOR
Who showed you this power? Who
controls the would-be-king?

LOKI
I am a king!

THOR
Not here. You give up the
Tesseract; you give up this
poisonous dream! You come home.

LOKI
I don’t have it.

Thor summons Mjolnir and holds it ready.
You need the Cube to bring me home
but I’ve sent it off I know not
where.

THOR
You listen well brother-

Iron Man flies in, knocking him and Thor out of frame. Loki
stands waiting.

LOKI
I’m listening?

EXT. FOREST - SECONDS LATER

Thor and Iron Man crash through the trees to the ground,
Tony lifts his faceplate.

THOR
Do not touch me again.

TONY
Then don’t take my stuff.

THOR
You have no idea what you’re
dealing with.

TONY
Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth
mother know you wear-th her drapes?

THOR
This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
will face Asgardian justice.

TONY
He gives up the Cube, he’s all
yours. Until then-

Faceplate drops.

IRON MAN
-stay out of the way.

Iron Man takes a few steps.
Tourist.

Thor throws
Mjolnir, hitting Iron Man square in the chest,
sending him flying, landing on his back.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

TONY
Okay!

BACK TO SCENE:

Loki smirks from the cliff top as Thor summons Mjolnir then
swings it in circles. Iron Man gets to his feet and fires a
repulse blast at Thor, then flies at him, kicking him
through a tree.

Thor stands, summoning a bolt of lightning as Loki watches
in the distance. Thor sends the bolt at Iron Man.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

JARVIS
Power at four hundred percent
capacity.

CONTINUED: (3)

TONY
How bout that?

BACK TO SCENE:

Iron Man fires at Thor. The two stand ready then fly at each
other, smashing through the trees and scraping up a cliff
side.

Trees are toppled as they crash to the forest grounds. Thor
and Iron Man stand quickly. Thor sends in a left hook so
Iron Man is about to punch but Thor grabs his fist. Iron Man
is about to send in his left hook and Thor grabs that too.

Thor begins to crush Iron Man’s right gauntlet with ease.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

Tony looks at the HUD which is alerting him. He groans and
thinks.

BACK TO SCENE:

Iron Man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires
a blast at Thor’s face -- it does nothing to Thor so he head
butts him. Thor headbutts him back. Iron Man flies back,
coming to a stop before launching himself at Thor.

Iron Man throws Thor into a broken tree. Thor then stands
and the two go at it for a bit longer -- a fist fight. Thor
summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of Tony
but Iron Man ditches, causing Thor to fall.

Behind the rising Thor, Iron Man swoops in and punches him.
They get ready to sends blows at each other until Cap’s
shield ricochets off both their chest.

CAPTAIN AMERICA (O.S)
Hey!

Cap catches his shield.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
That’s enough!

He jumps down of the tree and approaches Thor and Iron Man.
Now I don’t know what you plan on
doing here-

THOR
I’ve come here to put an end to
Loki’s schemes!

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (4)
51.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Then prove it. Put that hammer
down.

IRON MAN
Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves
his hammer-

Thor swings his hammer back, sending Iron Man behind him.

THOR
You want me to put hammer down?

Thor leaps, swinging Mjolnir, Cap raises the shield over his
head. When the two connect there is a loud boom and a flash
of light. The three are thrown backwards. They slowly get to
their feet and come together.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Are we done here?

Thor looks around.

INT. HALL, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS

Loki is escorted down the halls by a troop of armed
guards.
He walks past a window -- the wishbone lab, where
Banner is working. Loki smiles through the window at him.
Banner removes his glasses and rubs his temples.

75
INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS
75

Loki is locked in a cylindrical glass cage. Fury walks in
and over to a control panel.

FURY
In case it’s unclear, you try to
escape- you so much as scratch that
glass-

Fury pushes a button and the floor beneath the cell drops
away to nothing, the wind screams.
Thirty thousand feet straight down
in a steel trap. You get how that
works?

He pushes a button and closes the floor. He gestures first
to Loki.
Ant. (gestures to panel) Boot.

(CONTINUED)

LOKI
It’s an impressive cage. Not built,
I think, for me.

FURY
Built for something a lot stronger
than you.

Oh I’ve heard. (turns to a
camera)...

INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS
76

On the glass table a monitor is up -- Loki on it, watching
it is Natasha. As Loki talks she looks up at Banner. Banner
looks at her, smirking about her cage comment earlier.
...A mindless beast- makes play
he’s still a man...

We see Thor listen intently.
...How desperate are you, that you
call on such lost creatures to
defend you?

FURY (V.O)
How desperate am I?...

77
INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 77

Fury moves toward the cage slowly.
...You threaten my world with war,
you steal a force you can’t hope to
control, you talk about peace and
you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have
made me very desperate. You might
not be glad that you did.

LOKI
Ooh. It burns you to have come so
close, to have the Tesseract, to
have power- unlimited power, and
for what? (smiles and faces the
camera) A...

Well, let me know if ’real power’
wants a magazine or something.

Fury exits.

INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS

The monitor on Cap’s side of the table turns off. Steve, in
suit with no cowl, looks up.

BANNER
He really grows on you doesn’t he?

STEVE
Loki’s gonna drag this out. So,
Thor, what’s his play?

THOR
He has an army called the Chitauri.
They’re not of Asgard nor any world
known. He means to lead the against
your people. They will win him the
Earth, in return, I suspect, for
the Tesseract.

STEVE
An army, from outer space?

BANNER
So, he’s building another portal.
That’s what he needs Erik Selvig
for.

THOR
Selvig?

BANNER
He’s an astrophysicist.

THOR
He’s a friend.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
54.

NATASHA
Loki has them under some kind of
spell- along with one of ours.

STEVE
I wanna know why Loki let us take
him. He’s not leading an army from
here.

BANNER
I don’t think we should be focusing
on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag
full of cats, you can small crazy
on him.

THOR
Have care how you speak. Loki is
beyond reason but he is of Asgard,
and he is my brother.

NATASHA
He killed eighty people in two
days.

THOR
He’s adopted?

BANNER
I think it’s about the mechanics.
Iridium, what do they need the
Iridium for?

Tony and Coulson come walking in.

TONY
It’s a stabilizing agent.
(to Coulson, quietly)
I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll
fly you to Portland. Keep love
alive.

Coulson peels off from Tony, who is heading over to Thor.
Means the portal won’t collapse on
itself like it did at SHIELD.
(to Thor)
No hard feelings point break, you
got a mean swing.

Thor gives Tony a look as he walks to the control panels.

TONY
Also, means the portal can open as
wide and stay open as long as Loki
wants.

(to SHIELD personnel)
Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the
topsails.

The personnel look at him strangely.
That man is playing Galaga! Thought
we wouldn’t notice, but we did.

Standing now at the command area of the ship, Tony covers
one eye.
(to Hill)
How does Fury even see these?

MARIA HILL
(attitude)
He turns!

TONY
Sounds exhausting!

He begins messing with the screens, sticking something to
the underside of a desk.
The rest of the raw materials,
Agent Barton can get his hands on
pretty easily. Only major component
he still needs is a power source-
of high energy density. Something
to- kick start the Cube.

MARIA HILL
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics?

TONY
Last night. The packet, Selvig’s
notes, the extraction theory
papers- am I the only one who did
the reading?

STEVE
Does Loki need any particular kind
of power source?

BANNER
He’s have to heat the Cube to a
hundred and twenty million kelvin
just to break through the Coulomb
barrier.

TONY
Unless, Selvig has figured out how
to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling
effect.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (4)

BANNER
Well, if he could do that he could
achieve heavy-ion fusion at any
reactor on the planet.

TONY
Finally. Someone who speaks
English.

STEVE
(to the others)
Is that what just happened?

Stark and Banner shake hands.

TONY
It’s good to meet you, Doctor
Banner. Your work on
anti-electronic collisions is
unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of
the way you- lose control and turn
into an enormous green rage
monster.

BANNER
...Thanks.

Fury enters.

FURY
Doctor Banner is only here to track
the Cube. I was hoping you might
join him.

STEVE
I’d start with that stick of his.
It may be magical but it works an
awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

FURY
I don’t know about that, but it is
powered by the Cube. And I like to
know how Loki used it to turn two
of the sharpest men I know into his
personal flying monkeys.

THOR
Monkeys? I do not understand-

STEVE
I do!

The entire room goes instantly silent, staring at Steve.

STEVE (CONT’D)

This way, sir.

The two men walk off.

ON A SHIELD WORKER: He resumes play Galaga again.

81
INT. WISHBONE LAB, CARRIER - NIGHT
81

Banner and Stark are working on tracking the Cube. Banner is
scanning the scepter with a device.

BANNER
The Gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig’s reports on
the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take
weeks to process.

Stark works on a screen.

TONY
If we bypass their mainframe and
direct route to the Homer cluster
we can clock this at around six
hundred teraflops.

BANNER
All I packed was a toothbrush.

TONY
(giggles a bit)
You know, you should come by Stark
Tower some time. Top ten floors-
all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a
candy land.

BANNER
Thanks but...last time I was in New
York I kind of broke...Harlem.

TONY
Well, I promise a stress free
environment. No tension, no
surprises.

He zaps Banner in the side.

BANNER
Ow!

STEVE
Hey!

TONY
Nothing?

Steve approaches.

STEVE
Are you nuts?

TONY
Jury’s out!
(to Banner)
You really have got a lid on it,
haven’t you? What’s your secret?
Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag
of weed?

STEVE
Is everything a joke to you?

TONY
Funny things are.

STEVE
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn’t funny. No
offense, Doc.

BANNER
No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have
come aboard if I couldn’t handle
pointy things.

TONY
You’re tip-toeing, big man. You
need to strut.

STEVE
And you need to focus on the
problem, Mister Stark.

TONY
You think I’m not? Why did Fury
call us in? Why now, why not
before? What isn’t he telling us? I
can’t do the equation unless I have
all the variables.

(CONTINUED)

STEVE
You think Fury’s hiding something?

TONY
He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy.
His secrets have secrets.

He gestures to Banner.
It’s bugging him to, isn’t it?

BANNER
Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my
work here and-

STEVE
Doctor?

BANNER
A warm light for all mankind,"
Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube.

STEVE
I heard it.

BANNER
Well, I think that was meant for
you.

He gestures to Stark, who offers him a blueberry.
Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki
about the tower, it was still all
over the news.

STEVE
The Stark Tower? That big ugly-

Stark gives him a look.
-building in New York?

BANNER
It’s powered by an arc reactor,
self-sustaining energy source. That
building will run itself for, what,
a year?

TONY
It’s just the prototype.
(to Rodgers)
I’m kind of the only name in clean
energy right now, that’s what he’s
getting at.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (4)
60.

BANNER
So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in
on the Tesseract project? What are
they even doing in the energy
business in the first place?

TONY
I should probably look into that as
soon as my decryption program
finishes breaking into all of
SHIELD’s secure files.

STEVE
I’m sorry did you say-

TONY
JARVIS has been running it since I
hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll
know every dirty secret SHIELD has
ever tried to hide. Blueberry?

STEVE
Yet you’re confused about why they
didn’t want you around.

TONY
An intelligence organization that
fears intelligence? Historically,
not awesome.

STEVE
I think Loki’s trying to wind us
up. This is a man who means to
start a war and if we don’t stay
focused he’ll succeed. We have
orders, we should follow them.

TONY
Following’s not really my style.

STEVE
And you’re all about style, aren’t
you?

TONY
Out of the people in this room,
which one is "A" wearing a spangly
outfit and "B" not of use?

BANNER
Steve, tell me none of this smells
a little funky to you?

STEVE
Just find the Cube.

Cap exits the lab, pauses and turns, walking off in another
direction.

TONY
That’s the guy my dad never shut up
about? Wondering if they shouldn’t
have kept him on ice.

BANNER
Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does
have the jump on us.

TONY
What he’s got is an ACME dynamite
kit. It’s gonna blow up in his
face, and I’m gonna be there when
it does.

BANNER
I’ll read all about it.

TONY
Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with
the rest of us.

BANNER
Now, you see I don’t get a suit of
armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve,
it’s a nightmare.

TONY
You know, I’ve got a cluster
shrapnel, trying every second to
crawl its way into my heart. This
stops it-

He taps the arc reactor.
-this little circle of light. It’s
part of me now, not just armor.
It’s a terrible privilege.

BANNER
But you can control it.

TONY
Because I learned how.

It’s different.

Tony wipes clean the screen between them that Banner was

So you’re saying that the Hulk- the
Other Guy- saved my life? That’s

Coulson and Thor begins walking, through the bridge.

AGENT COULSON
He talks about you a lot. You
changed his life. You changed
everything around here.

THOR
They were better as they were. We
pretend on Asgard that we’re more
advanced, but we- we come here
battling like Bildschneip.

AGENT COULSON
Like what?

THOR
Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly,
big antlers. You don’t have those?

AGENT COULSON
No.

THOR
Huh! Well they are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their
path.

Thor moves over to a large window.
When I first came to earth, Loki’s
rage followed me here and your
people paid the price. And now
again. In my youth I courted war.

FURY
War hasn’t started yet. You think
you can make Loki tell us where the
Tesseract is?

THOR
I do not know. Loki’s mind is far
afield, it’s not just power he
craves, it’s vengeance upon me.
There’s no pain would prise his

NATASHA

Agent Barton.

LOKI

NATASHA
Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh-
well, I made a name for myself. I
have a very specific skill set. I
didn’t care who I used it for, or
on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a
bad way. Agent Barton was sent to
kill me, he made a different call.

LOKI
And what will you do if I vow to
spare him?

NATASHA
Not let you out.

LOKI
Ah, no. But I like this. Your world
in the balance, and you bargain for
one man?

NATASHA
Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not
to weep over that, I’m Russian, or
I was.

LOKI
And what are you now?

NATASHA
It’s really not that complicated. I
got red in my ledger. I’d like to
wipe it out.

LOKI
Can you? Can you wipe out that much
red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo?
The hospital fire? Barton told me
everything. Your ledger is
dripping, it’s gushing red, and you
think saving a man no more virtuous

they can’t be controlled.

STEVE
Like you controlled the cube!

THOR
Your work with the Tesseract is
what drew Loki to it, and his
allies. It is the signal to all the
realms that the earth is ready for
A HIGHER FORM OF WAR.

STEVE
A higher form?!

The only thing you really fight for

TONY
I think I would just cut the wire.

Always a way out. You know, you may

He stops, everyone is staring at him.
I got low. I didn’t see an end so I

You wanna know my secret, Agent

Everyone is watching Banner, Fury and Natasha reach for
their guns.

STEVE
Doctor Banner, put down the
scepter.

Banner looks down, surprised, to see the spear in his hand.
The monitor makes a noise, signaling the Tesseract has been

Got it!

His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
morphing to a growled threat. Banner begins to transform
into the Hulk, shirt tearing, he throws himself away from
Romanoff, who looks terrified, then he turns to look at her,
transforming -- just as the lights go out.

NATASHA
Bruce.

The transformation completes and Banner’s alter ego, the
Hulk, gets unsteadily to his feet, and roars. Romanoff
wrenches her foot free and stands looking -- and the Hulk
turns to look at her. She turns and runs up the catwalk
stairs as the Hulk chases her.

She swings over a catwalk, and rolls under a turbine, as the
Hulk tears down the stairs. Natasha jumps through small

walks.

Suddenly, the Hulk jumps at her, roaring. Romanoff fires her
gun at a pipe over his head and gas shoots out. She runs
along a narrow passage, the Hulk crashing through behind
her. He comes up on her fast. In slo-mo he catches up to her
as she is about to run off the passage -- he back hands her
against a wall.

He steps towards her. Natasha is groaning, unable to move,
scared. He raises a fist, about to strike, when he is
tackled through a wall by Thor. They are in the...

FURY
These were in Phil Coulson’s
jacket. Guess he never did get you
to sign them.

Fury scatters them on the table. Some are wet with blood.
We’re dead in the air up here. Our
communications, location of the
cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing
for you. Lost my one good eye.
Think I had that coming.

Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and
Tony.
Yes, we were going to build an
arsenal with the Tesseract. I never
put all my chips on that number,
though, because I was playing
something even riskier. There was
an idea, Stark knows this, called
the Avengers Initiative.

Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve
The idea was to bring together a
group of remarkable people, see if
they could become something more.
See if they could work together
when we needed them to, to fight
the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing
in that idea, in heroes.

Tony stands and walks out.
Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.

Banner wakes, naked, in a pile of rubble. There is a
SECURITY GUARD standing over him.

SECURITY GUARD
You fell out of the sky.

BANNER
Did I hurt anyone?

SECURITY GUARD
There’s nobody around here to get
hurt. You did scare the hell out of
some pigeons though.

BANNER
Lucky.

SECURITY GUARD
Or just good aim. You were awake
when you fell.

BANNER
You saw?

SECURITY GUARD
The whole thing, right through the
ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
nude. Here-

SECURITY GUARD throws Banner a some clothes, which he begins
to pull on.

BANNER
Thank you.

Are you an alien?

What?

SECURITY GUARD
From outer space, an alien?

BANNER
No.

SECURITY GUARD
Well then, son, you’ve got a
condition.

Banner steps down from the pile of rubble in the warehouse,
pulling on the shirt.

SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
So, which one is it?

BANNER
Sorry?

SECURITY GUARD
Are you a big guy that gets all
little, or a little guy that, ah-
sometimes blows up large?

BANNER
You know- I’m not even sure.

SECURITY GUARD
You got somewhere to go?

BANNER
Stark Tower. I- no.

The Security Guard looks at him.
Yes.

SECURITY GUARD
I’d expect some confusion of the
mind, since your body’s kind of all
over the place, but it has to be
one or the other.

The Security Guard gestures Banner to follow him.

BANNER
I know where I could do the most
good, but it’s where I can do the
most harm.

SECURITY GUARD
Well, that’s no different than
anybody else.

They walk out the doors.

Me? I’m here is Jersey where I
can’t do much of either. And since
I’m not likely to move on from this
placement, you may as well- pilfer
my ride.

The Security Guard gestures to an old motorcycle.

BANNER
I don’t know which way to go.

SECURITY GUARD
Your mind’s already made up, son.
The rest of you will follow.

Barton is strapped to a hospital bed. Natasha sits by him as
he strains against the bonds, breathing hard and shaking his
head.

NATASHA
Clint, you’re gonna be alright.

BARTON
You know that? Is that what you
know? I gotta go in though. I have
to flush him out.

NATASHA
You gotta level out, it’s gonna
take time.

BARTON
You don’t understand. Have you ever
had someone take your brain and
play? Pull you out and stuff
something else in? You know what
it’s like to be unmade?

NATASHA
You know that I do.

BARTON
Why am I back? How did you get him
out?

NATASHA
Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
really hard in the head.

BARTON
Thanks.

Natasha begins to remove the strap restraints.
Natasha, how many agents?

NATASHA
Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself,
Clint. This is Loki. This is
monsters and magic and nothing we
were ever trained for.

BARTON
Loki. He get away?

NATASHA
Yeah. I don’t suppose you know
where?

BARTON
Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask.
He’s gonna make his play soon
though. Today.

Natasha walks to the door.

NATASHA
We gotta stop him.

BARTON
Yeah? Who’s we?

NATASHA
I don’t know. Whoever is left.

BARTON
Well, if I put an arrow through
Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better
I suppose.

NATASHA
Now you sound like you.

BARTON
But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a
soldier. Now you want to wade into
a war. Why? What did Loki do to
you?

NATASHA
He didn’t, I just-

Tony stand over looking where the cylindrical glass cage
used to be. Steve enters the room.

STEVE
Was he married?

TONY
No. There was a uh- cellist, I
think.

STEVE
I’m sorry. He seemed like a good
man.

TONY
He was an idiot.

Tony and Steve slowly move toward each other.

STEVE
Why? For believing?

TONY
For taking on Loki alone.

STEVE
He was doing his job.

TONY
He was out of his league. He should
have waited. He should have-

STEVE
Sometimes there isn’t a way out,
Tony.

TONY
Right. How did that work for him?

STEVE
Is this the first time you’ve lost
a soldier?

TONY
We are not soldiers! I’m not
marching to Fury’s fife.

STEVE
Neither am I. He’s got the same
blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that
behind us and get this done. Now
Loki needs a power source, if we
can put together a list-

Tony looks down at the place Coulson fell, there is a dent
in the wall.

TONY
He made it personal.

STEVE
That’s not the point.

TONY
That is the point. That’s Loki’s
point. He hit us all right where we
live. Why?

STEVE
To tear us apart.

TONY
Yeah, divide and conquer is great
but- he knows he has to take us out
to win, right? That’s what he
wants. He wants to beat us, he
wants to be seen doing it. He wants
an audience.

STEVE
Right. I caught his act in
Stuttgart.

TONY
Yeah. That’s just previews, this
is- this is opening night. And
Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He
wants flowers, he wants parades, he
wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered....Son

slowly reaches.

JARVIS
Sir, I turned off the arc reactor.
The device is already
self-sustaining

IRON MAN
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

JARVIS
It’s too late! She can’t stop now.
She wants to show us something! A
new universe.

IRON MAN
(annoyed)
Okay.

He fires at the barrier around the device, but the Tesseract
deflects it, sending the energy outwards, knocking Selvig
out and Iron Man back.

JARVIS
The barrier is pure energy. It’s
unbreachable.

IRON MAN
Yeah, I got that.

Iron Man looks down to see Loki on the platform outside the
penthouse.
I’m beat.

JARVIS
Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready

Inside the tower, Loki walks forward as Tony goes behind his
bar.

LOKI
Please tell me you’re going to
appeal to my humanity.

TONY
Uh- actually, I’m planning to
threaten you.

LOKI
You should have left your armor on
for that.

TONY
Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage.
You’ve got the uh- blue stick of
destiny. Would you like a drink?

LOKI
Stalling me won’t change anything.

TONY
No, no, no- threatening. No drink?
You sure? I’m having one.

LOKI
The Chitauri are coming, nothing
will change that. What have I to
fear?

TONY
The Avengers. It’s what we call
ourselves, sort of like a team.
’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of
thing.

LOKI
Yes, I’m met them.

TONY
Yeah, takes us a while to get any
traction, I’ll give you that one.
But, let’s do a head count here.
Your brother, the Demi-God;

Loki turns away and Tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his
wrists.
A super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend;
a man with breath-taking anger
management issues; a couple of
master assassins, and you, big
fella, you’ve managed to piss off
every single one of them.

LOKI
That was the plan.

Tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where
Loki is.

TONY
Not a great plan. When they come,
and they will, they’ll come for
you.

LOKI
I have an army.

TONY
We have a Hulk.

LOKI
Oh, I thought the beast had
wandered off.

TONY
Yeah- you’re missing the point.
There’s no throne, there is no
version of this, where you come out
on top. Maybe your army comes and
maybe it’s too much for us, but
it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t
protect the earth, you can be
damned well sure we’ll avenge it.

Loki walks over to Tony, pointing his scepter.

LOKI
How will your friends have time for
me, when they’re so busy fighting
you?

Loki walks up to Tony, and places the tip of the scepter
over his heart. It clinks against the arc reactor.
This usually works.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

TONY
Well, performance issues. You know?

Loki grabs Tony by the throat and throws him across the
room.
JARVIS, anytime now.

Loki grabs Tony again.

LOKI
You will all fall before me.

TONY
JARVIS. Deploy.

Loki sends Stark crashing through the window, and plummeting
toward the ground.

TONY (O.S)
Deploy!

Behind Loki, the Mark Seven suit goes rocketing past and out
after Stark....

It catches up to him and, locking on to the bracelets,
attaches to him and unfolds to a full suit. Tony manages to
stop his fall moments before he hits the ground and flies
back up to Loki at the window.

IRON MAN
And there’s one other person you
pissed off! His name is Phil.

Iron Man fires a repulsor blast at Loki and he is knocked
down. Meanwhile the device has powered up and shoots a
stream of blue energy at the sky, which opens into a portal
where the Chitauri army waits. The hoards of aliens begin to
fly through.

LOKI
You can’t. There is no stopping it.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
You think you can hold them off?

BARTON
Captain, it would be my genuine
pleasure.

Barton grabs a arrow and shoots it, hitting one alien in the
head, the arrow quickly separates into more arrows, killing
three Chitauri aliens.

Cap leaves the other two fighting and jumps off an overpass,
rolling onto a bus and into the street.

Barton helps people off a bus as Natasha shoots her pistols

Cap jumps down on the car in front of them.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

You need men in these buildings.
There are people inside and they

POLICE SERGEANT
Why the hell should I take orders
from you?

Two Chitauri warriors attack Cap, he fights them off easily
then turns back to the two men. The two cops stand shock.
The POLICE SERGEANT reacts and walks back to his men.

POLICE SERGEANT

Barton and Natasha are fighting warrior up close. Barton
trips one with his bow. He pulls an arrow and stabs it.
Natasha is using her Widow’s Bite on a warrior as she sits
on his neck.

Natasha picks up a Chitauri weapon and is using it to fight
off the warriors. One warrior tries to slice her head off
and she slides, dodging it. She jumps to her feet and hits
it in the head with the sharp part of the weapon.

Barton knocks over another warrior. He grabs an arrow and
shoots behind himself, killing another warrior. He marches
over to another Chitauri and battles him. Meanwhile Natasha
is taking on three warriors by herself. She shoots one, then
spins around and stabs one in the neck.

Barton is tackled to the cement by a warrior. He groans and
stabs one with a arrow, then throws the warrior to the
ground. Out of nowhere, another Chitauri attacks him and
kicks him onto the trunk of a cab.

Natasha stabs a warrior with the Chitauri weapon. She hits
the other over the head. She spins to her knees, aims in one
direction, and fires. Another Chitauri charges, she spins
the weapon in that direction and fires. She continuously
fires as Barton fights more aliens in the background.

Barton’s head is slammed into the roof of a car. He is then
thrown to the ground by a warrior. He’s tired, but he
continues to fight.

Natasha takes on two more Chitauri. They back her onto a
taxi cab. They hit after her but she moves her head out of
the way. She gets her footing, and tries to hit them with
the weapon but a warrior grabs it and throws her feet into
the air. She lands on the car and screams in pain, breathing
heavily.

Barton shoots more warriors around them, they are becoming
overwhelmed but they keep on. Natasha regains her strength,
runs to the aid of Barton by firing at Chitauri as he slides

surrounded by Chitauri and Cap rejoins them -- hitting
Chitauri out the way. Thor drops down from the tower and
kills Chitauri with a bolt of lightening.

Iron Man draws the creature low and it skims the road.
Banner turns an begins to walk away, towards the Leviathan.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Doctor Banner, now might be a

angry.

BANNER

Banner transforms into the Hulk and punches the Leviathan,

Alright, listen up. Until we can

three blocks out, you turn it back
