Three Airmen, kids with battle-worn faces.  Crammed in there 
with them is a Man in an expensive suit, who looks tele-
ported from Beverly Hills. 

He is, of course, genius inventor and billionaire, TONY 
STARK.  In his hand is a drink tumbler of vodka.

TONY
Oh, I get it.  You guys aren’t 
allowed to talk.  Is that it?  Are 
you not allowed to talk?

One Airman grins, fidgeting with his orange NY Mets watch. 

JIMMY
No.  We’re allowed to talk.

TONY
Oh.  I see.  So it’s personal.

RAMIREZ
I think they’re intimidated.

TONY
Good God, you’re a woman.

The others try to compress laughs.

TONY (CONT'D)
I, honestly, I couldn’t have called 
that.
(after silence)
I would apologize, but isn’t that 
what we’re going for here? I saw 
you as a soldier first.

JIMMY
I have a question, sir.

TONY
Please.

JIMMY
Is it true you’re twelve for twelve  
with last years Maxim cover girls?

TONY
Excellent question. Yes and no.  
March and I had a schedule conflict 
but, thankfully, the Christmas 
cover was twins.  Anyone else?  
You, with the hand up.

PRATT
It’s a little embarrassing.

TONY
Join the club.

PRATT
Can I take a picture with you?

TONY
Are you aware that Native Americans 
believe photographs steal a little 
piece of your soul?
(then)
Not to worry, mine’s long gone.  
Fire away.

Pratt, excited, poses as another Airman snaps the photo.  A 
second later --

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks them.  Through the windshield, the 
Humvee ahead of them erupts in a fireball.

Tony is flung aside, and in the side-mirror --

The Humvee behind them EXPLODES.  Pandemonium as --  

The Airmen are instantly in battle mode.  They scramble out,

A line of armed hooded men and a banner showing ten 
interlocked rings.  The Leader, a huge Choori knife in one

President Roosevelt declares the 
United States will build fifty 
thousand planes to fight the armies 
of Hirohito and Hitler--

S.S. Officers goose-step through Paris.

NARRATOR
Although no such capacity to build 
existed...

1940s L.A., an unassuming hangar reads: “STARK INDUSTRIES.”

NARRATOR
Howard Stark, founder of the 
fledgling Stark Industries, answers 
his call to duty --

A Young Howard Stark shakes FDR’s hand.

NARRATOR
And builds not fifty, but a hundred 
thousand planes.

An airfield covered in B-29s.  Stark bombers in flight, 
strewing bombs and paratroopers across the sky.

NARRATOR
Later, Stark’s work on the 
Manhattan project makes the end of 
the war possible.  

A mushroom cloud in the New Mexico desert.  Howard Stark 
observes with Oppenheimer.  

NARRATOR
Stark Industries would go on to 
contribute to every major weapons 
system through the Cold War --

Korean War, B-52s, ICBMS, nuclear subs, F-16s launching from 
carriers.  Howard Stark with Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon.

NARRATOR
But Howard Stark’s greatest 
achievement would come in 1973--

President Ford, holding baby Tony, posing with Howard.  Four 
year-old Tony building a massive building-block city.  Howard 
and twelve year-old Tony assembling a hot-rod engine.

NARRATOR
From early on, it was clear that 
Tony Stark had a unique gift--

Tony working on TURBINE ENGINES in a hangar full of F-18s.

NARRATOR
At seventeen he graduated summa cum 
laude from MIT.  Four years later, 
tragedy would pass the Stark mantle 
from father to son--

Howard’s funeral.  Tony with Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton.

NARRATOR
The loss of a titan.  But Tony did 
not let personal grief distract him 
from his duty --

Tony cuts the ribbon on a brand new ARK REACTOR at Stark 
Industries West Coast HQ.

NARRATOR
At twenty-one, he became the 
youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 
company.  And with it came a new 
mandate --

A laser-guided bomb hits its target.  

NARRATOR
Smarter weapons, fewer casualties.  
A dedication to preserving life.   

A visual crescendo of America’s modern military might.

NARRATOR
Today Tony Stark’s ingenuity 
continues to protect freedom and 
American interest around the globe.

A waving American flag superimposed with an Annie Liebowitz 
portrait of Tony.  And as it fades out, APPLAUSE, then --

A light shines on a podium, revealing Lt. Colonel Rhodes.

RHODEY
As Program Manager and Liaison to 
Stark Industries, I’ve had the 
honor of serving with a real 
patriot, a man whose life has been 
dedicated to protecting our troops 
on the front lines.  He’s a friend. 
And a great mentor.  A man who has 
always been there for his friends 
and his country.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, this year’s ARES Award 
winner -- Mr. Tony Stark.  

THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. A spotlight fixes on Tony Stark -- or 
rather -- his empty chair.  Applause wanes, lights fade up --

Military brass, politicians, movers and shakers.  Heads 
swivel and MURMUR -- where’s Tony?

OBADIAH STANE (50s), CFO of Stark Industries, regards the 
empty chair.  He makes his way to the podium.  Awkward.  

OBADIAH
Thank you...I, uhhh, I’m not Tony 
Stark, but if I were Tony, I’d tell 
you how honored I am and...what a 
joy it is to receive this award.  
(then) The best thing about Tony is 
also the worst thing -- he’s always 
working.

Tony plays craps, a crowd erupting as they all win big.  
Chips pile up.  Tony’s flanked on both sides by lucky ladies.

In between rolls, he whispers into one Woman’s ear --

‘moment’ here, but this is actually 
the logical conclusion of several 
mathematical truisms.

He rolls again.  The table is hot.  More cheers.

TONY

My God, what are you, they roped 
you into this thing too?

RHODEY
Yeah.  They said you’d be deeply 
honored if I presented. 

TONY
Okay, let’s do it.  

Rhodey plops the ARES statue down on the felt.

TONY
That was quick.  Thought there’d be 
more of, you know, a ceremony.  
Maybe a highlight reel --

Tony shakes karma into the dice, rolls again.  He craps out.  
Groans from the table, everyone staring at Rhodey the

(turns others)  My chaperone has 
just arrived with my -- (holding 
the ARES) -- Degenerate of the Year 
Award.  Judging from his look, I 
may have just peed in the kiddie 
pool.

The Boxman racks up Tony’s chips. 

TONY
I must now take my ease, along with 
the House’s funds.  

He’s handed racks of chips, then tips the table Operators and 
heads off with Rhodey.  Two hotel Security Guards fall in 
behind.  As they meander past tables --

People gawk, snap photos of Tony with their phones.

RHODEY
A lot of people would kill to have 
their name on that award.  

TONY
It belongs to my old man.  They 
should have given it to him.  

RHODEY
What’s wrong with you?  A thousand 
people came here tonight to honor 
you, and you leave them with egg on 
their face.  This award means 
something, Tony, it’s bigger than 
you --

TONY
Hold that thought a sec.

He’s stopped in front of a roulette wheel.  Puts all his 
chips down on, nods to wheel operator.

TONY
Put it all on black.  Don’t worry -- 
it’s approved.  

The Wheel Operator spins -- 

CLOSE ON - ROULETTE WHEEL: the ball finally settling on red.

The Dealer scoops away Tony’s chips.

An empty palatial bathroom.  Tony’s in the stall on his 
throne.  Rhodey splashes his face by the mirrors.  

TONY (IN STALL)
Of course I respect your opinion.

RHODEY
This is no joke.  You’re going into 
a hot zone.  We should be doing 
this test here in Nevada.

TONY (IN STALL)
This system has to be demonstrated 
in true field conditions.

The Bathroom door swings open and VIRGINIA “PEPPER” POTTS 
enters, Tony’s sexy and very capable assistant.  

PEPPER
Tony, it’s the President.  Wants to 
congratulate you personally.  Heads 
up.

She tosses the cellphone over the top of the stall.  All very 
routine.   Rhodey listens to Tony talk, shaking his head. 

TONY (IN STALL)
...Jim, how’re the trout running?  
Yeah, sitting on top of the world 
here.  Working on my masterpiece --

Tony washes up.  As they leave, Rhodey drops money in the

the basket and follows Rhodey out.

The Board meeting is on the

expect an appearance--?  

WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. Stark!

Tony turns, spots CHRISTINE EVERHART, a hot young Reporter 
holding a recorder.  Security keeps her at bay.

CHRISTINE
Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair 
Magazine.  Can I ask you a few 
questions?

TONY
Can I ask a few back?

She gives him a disarming smile.  Tony waves at Security to 
let her through.  Pepper shakes her head, then takes a call.

CHRISTINE
You’ve been described as a Da Vinci 
for our times.  What do you say to 
that?

TONY
Ridiculous.  I don’t paint. 

CHRISTINE
And what do you say to your other 
nickname: “The Merchant of Death?”

weapons are no longer needed to 
keep the peace, I’ll start 
manufacturing bricks and beams to 
make baby hospitals.

CHRISTINE
Rehearse that much, Mr. Stark?

TONY
Every night in front of the mirror.  
Call me Tony. 

CHRISTINE
I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for 
a serious answer.   

TONY
Here’s serious: my old man had a 
philosophy: peace means having a 
bigger stick than the other guy.

CHRISTINE
Good line, coming from the guy 
selling the sticks.  

TONY
My father helped defeat Hitler.  He 
was on the Manhattan Project.  A 
lot of people -- including your 
professors at Brown -- might call 
that being a hero. 

CHRISTINE
Others might call it war-
profiteering.

Tony has to smile, this gal is relentless.   

TONY
Tell me: do you plan to report on 
the millions we’ve saved by 
advancing medical technology?  Or 
kept from starving with our inteli-
crops?  All were breakthroughs 
spawned from, that’s right, 
military funding.

Wow.  You ever lose an hour of

and oblivious to the flight attendants dancing next to them.

RHODEY

You don’t get it.  I don’t work for 
the military because they paid for 
my education, or my father’s 
education.  Don’t cheapen it like 
that.    

TONY 
All I said was, with your smarts, 
your engineering background, you 
could write your own ticket in the 
private sector -- on top of which, 
you wouldn’t have to wear that 
‘straight-jacket’.  

RHODEY
‘Straight-jacket’?  This uniform 
means something.  A chance to make 
a difference.  You don’t respect 
that, because you don’t understand.

TONY

See that one?  Her I understand.  
Croatian.  Hot-blooded, I’m

Zagreb --

RHODEY

saying. 

TONY

Tony exits the plane, fresh, fired up to greet the waiting

Rhodey appears dressed in ABUs.  He’s weary, squinting at the 
stinging sun.  Pulls his sunglasses down over bleary eyes.

Three JERICHO MISSILES on a ‘flatbed’ (which have been 
unloaded from a military jet in the b.g.) are brought under 
heavy guard to a waiting convoy.

Tony firing a N.R.F. 425 MACHINE GUN.

Generals sit on folding chairs behind a safe-zone of Hescos 
and sand-bags.  Afghani soldiers and SF (Air Force security) 
men patrol the perimeter.    

Tony puts the N.R.F. 425 gun down next to other weapons.  He 
struts before the Generals like a carnival barker.

TONY
The age old question: is it better 
to be feared or respected?  I say, 
is it too much to ask for both?

He nods at the Jericho Missile, on a mobile launcher. 

TONY
With that in mind, I humbly present 
the crown jewel of Stark Industries 
Freedom Line.  It’s the first 
missile system to incorporate my 
proprietary Repulsor Technology.   
They say the best weapon is one you 
never have to fire.  I prefer the 
one you only have to fire once...  
 

The Jericho ROARS into the sky from a mobile launcher.

into scores of mini-missiles.

A row of majestic peaks behind him.  He raises his arms.

TONY
For your consideration, the 
Jericho...

The mountains behind his outstretched hands explode.

The shock-wave washes over Tony, blanking him with dust.

REVERSE ANGLE 

As the shock-wave erases the observing Generals with dust. 

TONY
Now there’s one last creation I 
haven’t shown anyone yet.  You 
might be interested...  

He opens a large silver case.  Ice-smoke curls out, then --

A bottle appears.  Drink glasses.  As Tony pours the Generals 
and Afghani military officials exchange awkward glances.

To peace, gentlemen...and with

Tony flickers awake, disoriented.  A tube protrudes from his

Yinsen, humming a tune as he shaves by a broken mirror.  But 
more importantly right now --

There is a jug of water on the table.

Tony tries to speak, can’t.  It’s the damn nasal tube.  He 
pulls at it, gagging as two of feet of tubing slithers from 
his nose.

TONY

...water...water.

Yinsen keeps humming.  Tony yanks the IV from his arm and 
stretches for the water, but is stopped by --

A wire, under his chest bandages, snapping taut.  

YINSEN
I wouldn’t do that if I were you.

Tony follows the wire with his eyes and finds, to his horror, 
that it’s hooked up to a car battery.

He starts clawing at his chest bandages.  Yinsen turns.  

Tony sees his ugly chest wound.  It’s too much.  He swoons.

Tony eyes the bulky chest-piece protruding from his fresh 
bandages.

TONY
What have you done to me?

YINSEN
What did I do?  I removed what I 
could, but there’s a lot left 
headed for you atrial septum.  Do 
you want a souvenir?

He tosses Tony a jar with scores of bloody Christmas tree-
like barbs.   Tony regards the ‘shrapnel’ he owns the patent 
to, and lets the jar drop. 

YINSEN
I’ve seen many wounds like this in 
my village.  The walking dead we 
called them, because it took a week 
for the barbs to reach vital 
organs.  I anchored a magnetic 
suspension system to the plate.  
It’s holding the shrapnel in 
place...at least for now. 

Tony struggles up, sits on the cot and notices something --

YINSEN
That’s right, smile. (then) We met 
once -- at a technical conference 
in Bern.

Tony gets to his feet, can’t gets his hands up.  Yinsen helps 
him.

YINSEN
Listen to me, whatever they ask 
you, refuse.  You understand?  You

The door opens and ABU BAKAR enters with two armed Henchmen

We find Tony, bearded and filthy now, cutting metal flat-

over his shoulder at --

Yinsen concentrating on building a backgammon board.

Tony secretly begins filling a cylinder with gas from the 
torch.

YINSEN

Stark, tell me what you’re doing, 
and I’ll tell you what I’m doing.

TONY
Looks to me like you’re making a 
crappy backgammon board.

Crappy?  This is Lebanese cedar.

you’re really making.

TONY
“A” I don’t know what your talking

YINSEN
Interesting, I was the champion at 
Cambridge.

TONY
Please don’t use ‘interesting’ and

The door-slat flies open.  Abu again.  He barks, more stern

clatters to the floor.  Yinsen notices, looks at Tony. 

Abu, Ahmed and Omar enter, followed by RAZA’S GUARDS.  They 
take up positions, rigid.  Raza enters (he speaks English). 

RAZA
Relax.

They lower their hands.  Silence as Raza meanders, picking up 
and putting things down.  He almost steps on Tony’s secret 
cylinder, but then sees the washing machine.  He shoots Abu a 
cold look and turns to the workbench and --

Peruses Tony’s onion-paper schematics of the missile. 

RAZA
The bow and arrow was once the 
pinnacle of weapons technology.  It 
allowed the great Genghis Khan to 
rule from the Pacific to the 
Ukraine.

He pushes the schematics around trying to make sense of them.

Tony’s muscles ripple, sweat flying.

YINSEN (O.S.)
Year after year the Prince mined 
the heavy ore, becoming so strong 
he could crush pieces of it 
together with his bare hands.  Too 
late, the King realized his 
mistake... 

Dazzling sparks fly around Tony. 

YINSEN (O.S.)
When he struck at the Prince with 
his finest sword -- it broke in 
half.  The Prince himself had 
become strong as iron... 

Tony, sweating, holds up the metal he’s been working on --

INT.  STARK INDUSTRIES LOBBY - DAY

Packed with Reporters waiting for the hundred-carat headline.  
Pepper is approached by AGENT PHIL COULSON (40s).

PEPPER
You’ll have to take a seat, Sir.

COULSON
Oh, I’m not a reporter.  I’m Agent 
Phil Coulson with the Strategic 
Homeland Intervention, Enforcement 
and Logistics Division--

PEPPER
That’s a mouthful.  

COULSON
I know.  Here.

He hands her a card.  She squints at the tiny font.

PEPPER
Look, Mr. Coulson, we’ve already 
spoken with the D.O.D., the FBI, 
the CIA--

COULSON
We’re a separate division with a 
more...specific focus.  We need to 
debrief Tony about the 
circumstances of his escape.  More 
importantly-- 

PEPPER
(cutting him off)
Well, great, I’ll let him know--

COULSON
--we’re here to help.  We’re here 
to listen.  I assure you Mr. Stark 
will want to talk to us.

PEPPER
I’m sure he will.  Now if you could 
just take your seat.

NEW ANGLE

As Tony enters, struggling his way to the podium, followed by 
Obadiah.   

Tony gazes out over the reporters.  Suddenly he seems 
vulnerable, scattered. 

The silence grows awkward.  Obadiah is mercifully going to 
save him when --

TONY
I...can’t do this anymore. 

Pregnant silence.  Everyone waiting for the Stark punch-line.  
Finally, a Reporter ventures --

REPORTER # 1
You mean you’re retiring?

TONY
No, I don’t want to retire.  I want 
to do something else.

The room waits through more awkward silence, then --

REPORTER # 1
Something besides weapons?

TONY
Yes.  That’s right.  

The room is suddenly BUZZING with overlapping questions -- 

REPORTER #2
The official report was sketchy.  
What happened to you over there, 
Mr. Stark? 

Tony is pensive, then the floodgates open.  

TONY
What happened over there?  I had my 
eyes opened, that’s what happened.  
I saw my weapons, with my name on 
them, in the hands of thugs.  I 
thought we were doing good here...I 
can’t say that anymore.

Rhodey, just arriving in the rear, pulls up to Pepper. 

RHODEY
Uhh, weren’t we taking him to the 
hospital?

Pepper is transfixed.  Nearby, Agent Coulson watches 
stoically.

REPORTER #2
What do you intend to do about it, 
Mr. Stark?

TONY
The system is broken -- there’s no 
accountability  whatsoever.  Right 
now, as of this second, we are 
freezing the sale of all Stark 
weaponry worldwide.   

Now the room is in chaos.  Obadiah’s ready to wrap this up, 
and moves towards Tony.

TONY
We’ve lost our way.  I need to re-
evaluate things.  And my heart’s 
telling me I have more to offer the 
planet than things that blow up.  

REPORTER #3
So you’re saying...what are you 
saying?

TONY
(arm around Stane)
In the coming months, Mr. Stane 
here and I will set a new course 
for Stark Industries.  “Tomorrow 
Today” has always been our slogan.  
It’s time we try to live up to it. 

The questions are now firing in a CACOPHONY.  Obadiah takes 
the podium.

OBADIAH
Okay, I think we’re going to be 
selling a lot of newspapers here.

What we should take away from this 
is that Tony’s back, he’s healthier 
than ever, and as soon as he heals 
up and takes some time off, we’re 
going to have a little internal 
discussion and get back to you.  
Thank you for coming by.

Tony steps down, exhilarated.  He works his way through the 
swarming reporters, approaching Rhodey and Pepper -- who have 
stunned looks on their faces.

PEPPER
You mean that?  Or is this some 
clever stock-maneuver?

Tony, shirtless and wearing goggles, sits in the 3D laser 
scanner.  Lasers play over him, mapping his entire body.

JARVIS
What were your intentions for this 
device?

MONITORS: terabytes of data race past.

TONY
It powers an electromagnet which 
keeps the shrapnel from entering my 
heart. Can you recommend any 
ugrades?  

JARVIS
It is difficult to offer counsel in 
light of the fact that your stated 
intentions are inconsistent with 
your actions. 

MONITOR: Tony’s chest device magnified.  Its various 
components flashing as Jarvis analyzes them.

TONY
What are you talking about?  That 
is ridiculous.  That is exactly the 
purpose of this invention. 

MONITORS: going deeper and deeper through the strata of 
Tony’s device.  Like it’s a city unto itself.

Tony steps from the booth.  All around him, calculations 
flash at blinding speed.

TONY
Upgrade recommendations.  List. 

JARVIS
Why are you talking to me like a 
computer? 

TONY
Because you are acting like one.

JARVIS
Shall I disable random pattern

No.  It’s ok.  You are the only one 
who understands me.

I don’t understand you sir.

Should I activate sarcasm

Horses and old pickups, scattered as men scavenge among the 
dunes.  A Toyota pickup flies the banner of the Ten Rings.  A 
burly man, his back to us, leans on the bed-mounted machine-
gun.  As we TRACK around him we can see it’s -- 

Raza, his terrible scars still raw from Iron Man’s flame-

INT.  TONY’S WORKSHOP - DAYS LATER - DAY
88
88

Tony’s suit is now comprised of a stabilizer belt, partially-
chromed propulsion boots and the Mark II gauntlets. 
Everything connected by tubing and wires -- he looks like a 
crazy science experiment. 

Tony fires up the boots, hovers.  Then he fires the gloves to 
stabilize.  Weaving, tilting.  He “surfs” mid-air, trying to 
maintain balance, slowly getting the hang of it.  

Then he ventures forward, moving along the expanse of the 
lab.  Dodging pieces of equipment, his car collection, a few 
near misses -- but he maintains control.  Debris and objects 
are blown from tables from the propulsive force.  

The joy of flight. 

TONY
Nothing to it...

He cuts the propulsion and lands.  Looks to Jarvis.  

TONY
All right.  Let’s get to work.

Ailerons and air brakes pop up as Tony moves his head and 
arms, “stretching”, getting the feel for his new body.  

The helmet -- its intrepid, steely gaze boring into us.

Now we see the full-on Mark II suit, its seams and rivets 
still visible.  The suit HUMS as it powers up.  

TONY
Standby for calibration.

The gauntlets and boots fire up, and Tony rises.  Suddenly--

TONY
Whoa--

He loses balance, falls back onto the hood of his Saleen, 
crushing it.  The ALARM goes off.  Tony kills the alarm with 
a blast of RT.

TONY
We should take this outside.

JARVIS (O.S.)
I must strongly caution against 
that.  There are terabytes of 
calculations still needed --

TONY
We’ll do them in-flight.

The HUD comes alive as Jarvis “loads” into the suit’s on-

Tony fires boots and gauntlets again.  He hovers, floating 
along the workshop’s driveway.  

JARVIS (O.S.)
I suggest you allow me to employ 
Directive Four.

Tony, wearing a Mark III gauntlet, wired to his RT chest-
piece, turns a screwdriver to adjust the power.  

On the wall beside him --

A flatscreen TV: live war footage, refugees huddled.  The 
bottom crawl reads, “BREAKING NEWS - TRAGEDY IN GULMIRA.”

TV REPORTER’S VOICE
-- the ten mile drive to the 
outskirts of Gulmira can only be 
described as a descent into Hell, 
into a modern-day Heart of 
Darkness.  Simple farmers and 
herders, from peaceful villages, 
driven from their homes at the butt 
of Western rifles and the turrets 
of modern tanks.  Displaced from 
their lands by Warlords and 
insurgent groups emboldened by 
their newfound power -- a power 
fueled by high-tech weapons easily 
purchased with Poppy money on the 
black market -- and further 
destabilizing a fragile region 
which for decades has been a 
tinderbox of tribal feuding and 
ethnic hatred --

Tony aims the gauntlet at some light fixtures.  Gives them an 
RT blast.  They spark and fall from the ceiling.  

TV REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
The villagers have taken shelter in 
whatever crude dwellings they can 
find -- in the ruins of other razed 
villages, in the cold barren 
scrublands, or in the remnants of 
an old Soviet smelting plant.  Our 
translator relayed to us one human 
tragedy after another.  A seven 
year old boy, thin as a scarecrow, 
clutching yellowed photographs and 
holding them out to anyone who 
would stop, with a child’s simple 
question: where are my mother and 
father?  A woman, begging for news 
of her husband, who’d been 
kidnapped by insurgents -- either 
forced to join their militia, or to 
be shot without reason --

TONY
I’ll be right back.  Why don’t you 
two...get started without me.   

They laugh and he checks his watch, then slips out a side

A mortar explodes in our face.  Smoke drifts away revealing --

A terrified MOTHER and her FOUR KIDS huddled in a cave-like 
crawlspace.  She doesn’t have enough arms to cover them all.

THEIR POV - OF ‘ALLEY’ OUTSIDE: an abandoned industrial 
facility.  GUNFIRE, SCREAMING.  In the distance --

Ragged tents and shanties are beset upon by black clad 
Irregular Forces, firing and burning and destroying.

Soldiers toss grenades into rat holes.  Hunter-killer teams 
fire at offscreen targets -- then smile with satisfaction.

The oldest of the four kids in the crawlspace darts out into 
the alley, frantically calling -- 

KID
Arto!  ARTO!

On his way back he’s surprised by a four man hunter-killer 
team.  They shout at him to drop the puppy, but he won’t. 

The men cock their guns, briefly distracted by a strange 
rocket-streak in the sky.  Never mind, they take aim on the 
boy, and are about to fire when --

IRON MAN lands before them, slamming his fist to the ground 
in the classic Granov fist smash.  With a single RT blast -- 

The Soldiers are thrown fifty yards.  Tony scoops up the Kid, 
with the barking mutt in his arms, and they take off. 

NEW ANGLE - CRAWLSPACE

Iron Man drops down, delivering Kid and dog back to safety.  
The Kid, ignoring his mother’s protests, darts back out to 
watch Iron Man.  He sees --

A Soldier flying like a ragdoll from behind a heap of bricks.

The Boy moves for a better view and sees Iron Man in full 
terrible glory, deflecting withering fire while laying waste 
to a cluster of militants with his fists and bursts of RT.

Refugees slowly emerge from their cover, stunned to watch 
Soldiers retreating in fear.

CUT TO:

Raza, his wounds healed like papier-mâché, observing his 
retreating men from a command post.  He grabs a rifle, steps 
through a building, and spots -- 

Iron Man, in the distance, throwing a Soldier through a wall.

Raza scrunches into nook, riveted.

NEW ANGLE - IRON MAN

Picks a Soldier up, who’s about to fire an RPG.  Holds an RT 
palm to the man’s face.

SOLDIER

Geneva Convention!  Article Three!

Tony disarms the soldier, tosses him down.  The Soldier 
scrambles away for his life.

Suddenly Tony is jarred by a sniper’s bullet.

This is only a crude first effort.  
But he’s perfected his design-- 

Raza hands grainy surveillance photos to Stane.

Everything you will need to build 
this weapon.

Elite Engineers from the Stark empire are hard at work, 
milling and machining armored parts.  Obadiah walks among 
them.

OBADIAH
Civilization, gentlemen, has been 
preserved by the right people 
having the right idea at the right 
time.  You are shaping in your 
hands, this very moment, the future 
of this company, and this nation.  
But it is imperative this project 
remain data-masked, that it’s 
existence never leave these walls.  
Make no mistake -- this is a 
‘tool’, that in wrong hands, could 
jeopardize civilization as we know 
it. 

Obadiah faces the Head Engineer.

HEAD ENGINEER
Give us full access to the Sampson 
Cluster, and we’ll have you a 
prototype in record time.

hulking steel legs of the Dynamo, extending out of frame.  
The sparks from a welding gun shower down.

HEAD ENGINEER
There’s no technology that can 
power this thing.

OBADIAH
I told you, miniaturize the ARK 
reactor. 

HEAD ENGINEER
I’m sorry, Mr. Stane, I’ve tried.  
What you’re asking for can’t be

OBADIAH
Tony Stark was able to do it in a

suit.  For the pipe room under the Ark Reactor.  

PEPPER
What are you doing, Obadiah?

She glances towards the door, thinking she heard something.  
Waits.  Nothing.    

THE MONITOR: an icon now appears, with Arabic text 
underneath.  An icon for a video clip.  

She double clicks, watches--

MONITOR 

A grainy video clip opens: Tony, half-dead, tied to a chair.  
Raza and his henchmen behind him.  It’s the ‘decapitation 
tape’ made in the cave months ago. 

She shakes her head, disbelieving.  

PEPPER
Translate-- 

CLOSE ON - MONITOR: as the clip plays, the translated text 
appears like subtitles:  “Obadiah Stane, you have deceived 
us...the price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up...”

Pepper, shell-shocked, gapes at the monitor.  

PEPPER’S POV: she looks up from the monitor to see Stane 
standing there in the doorway.

She nearly leaps out of her skin.

OBADIAH
What a nice surprise.

PEPPER
I...just wanted to get some of my 
personal stuff. (nods to the 
monitor)  And my resume.  In case.

He circles her, picking up a photo on the desk of Tony.  
Pepper stiffens, flicks a glance at --

The hacking jump-drive protruding.  The WHIRR and GRIND of 
the hard drive as it copies Stane’s files. 

PEPPER
This...thing between you, it’s 
hurting him.  You’re the only real 
father Tony ever had. It would mean 
so much if you could just talk --

OBADIAH
(matter-of-fact)
Tony’s imploding -- it’s 
unfortunate.  (then)  You should 
consider whether you want to take 
that ride with him.  

PEPPER
“Unfortunate?”

OBADIAH
You know I love Tony -- but this is 
business.  We can’t save him, but 
we can save his legacy. 

She flashes to the download screen, “87%” completed.

OBADIAH
It’s tragic, but...Tony never 
really came home, did he?

He circles behind her again, looking closely at the screen-- 
again depicting Google ads.  

OBADIAH
This company has a bright future, 
I’d like you to be a part of it.   

He smiles and touches her cheek.  She shuts off the computer.

No.  Of course not.  I’ve been very

down on the table. 

OBADIAH
Easy, now.  Try to breathe...

He kneels beside Tony.  Unbuttons Tony’s shirt.  

OBADIAH
You can’t mess with progress, Tony.

He wraps the heart in cloth.  Then stands, clicking off the

The Dynamo raises the Harley over his head, ready to smash

The car hits Dynamo’s leg and crumples, tumbling away like a 
toy, and now --

The Dynamo, un-weighted, reels around to catch his balance, 
but pitches head-first into the hydrogen bus perforating it.

CLOSE ON - DYNAMO: struggling to free himself.  His groping 
fingers set off a spark and --

HELLFIRE ERUPTS -- blanking the Dynamo and everything around 
it.  Flames roll over Tony.  Over the crushed sports car, 
igniting its leaking tanks.

Tony removes his broken helmet and staggers to the car, 
tearing it open like a can.

TONY
You had to take my car.

He pulls out Rhodey, dazed and bloody. 

RHODEY
Saving your ass is getting to be a

He’s connecting a wire when the satellite dish beside him

for cover as the world goes steel-blue.  

An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) flashes upwards along the 
reactor.

As the searing flash of the EMP is momentarily ‘halted’ 
between the satellite dishes, vaporizing the roof in between.  
Then --

The EMP surges outwards, turning Dynamo and Iron Man into 
statues as the pulse knocks out his power and electronics.

FROM UP HIGH: the EMP blast travels concentrically outwards, 
rendering everything dark in its wake.

BACK TO:

The roof, as it sags down in the center.  

Tony, dazed, looks at his heart-device.  It’s dead too.

The Dynamo, closest to the collapsed section of the roof, 
topples over.  Its dead fingers catch on a seam and it lies 
precariously on the edge of the ‘slope’.

The Dynamo hatch opens, revealing Obadiah --

OBADIAH’S POV: through the hole in the roof, the seething 
plasma bubbling below.

Tony, using his own waning strength, tries to extend a dead 
Iron Man hand to Obadiah.

So this is the answer, Tony?  This 
is how you’re going to save the 
world?  It’s not in you.  Your 
father told me before he died, my 
boy doesn’t have a warrior’s heart. 
I should have listened.

TONY
My father never knew me.

OBADIAH
But I do.  

Now we see what Stane is attempting: to manually winch his 
forearm rocket bay open so he can blast Tony.  

But his movements unsettle the Dynamo suit and suddenly he 
begins to slide.

OBADIAH
Goodbye, my boy...

TONY
This is just the beginning.

And now Obadiah shuts the hatch and tumbles away.  He --   

Plunges down through the ARK’s silo -- splashes into the 
plasma which HISSES and swallows him up.

Tony remains, shutting his eyes.

Here, your alibi.  You were on your 
yacht.  I’ve got port papers that 
put you in Avalon all night, and 
sworn statements from fifty of your 
guests.     

TONY
Maybe it was just the two of us.  
On the yacht, I mean.

PEPPER
Focus, please.  

Tony grabs an L.A. Times from the pile of papers in her arms, 
glances at the headline: “WHO IS THE IRON MAN?”  A grainy 
newspaper photo of the iron battle at Stark Industries.

TONY
“Iron Man”.  Not technically 
accurate, since it’s mostly carbon-
fiber and ceramic.  But I like the 
ring of it.  “Iron Man”...  

They turn a corner.  Tony suddenly stops.  Meets her eyes.
