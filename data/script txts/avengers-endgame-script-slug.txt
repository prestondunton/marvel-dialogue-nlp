EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY

CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET.

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
Okay, you see where you’re going? 
Let’s work on how to get there.

Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, 
coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Okay, good...tip down...bow arm 
out...three fingers-

LILA BARTON
Why three?

CLINT BARTON
‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s 
too much-

LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
You guys want mustard or mayo, or 
both? 

CLINT TURNS.  IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA 
BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.  

LILA BARTON
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

CLINT BARTON
We’ll both have mustard, hon!
(to Lila)
Okay.  Draw back, deep breath...

She lets loose.  THUD!  HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. 

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Good job, Hawkeye.  Go get your 
arrow. 

LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
Enough murder practice!  Soup’s on!

CLINT BARTON
One sec, babe.  Be right there! 
We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. 
We’re hungry.

But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE.  The bow and arrow lie 
at his feet.  He stares.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Lila?  Babe, did you see Lila-

He turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE.  So are the boys.  The 
soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket.

NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Guys?  Guys, come on...

Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Laura?

Clint breaks into a panicked run. 

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
LAURA!

CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC...

MARVEL FLIP

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

BLACKNESS.  

TITLE: “TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.”

Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift...

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT

TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football.  She wins.

TONY
(offering his hand)
Good sport.  Have fun? 

Nebula studies his hand, confused.  Finally she shakes.

NEBULA
It was fun.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON 
MAN HELMET.  He hits a switch.  A light blinks.

TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.”

TONY 
This thing on?  Hey, Ms. Potts.  
Pep.  If you find this recording, 
don’t post it on social media.  
It’s going to be a real tearjerker.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.

TONY (O.S.)
I don’t know if you’re ever going 
to see these.  I don’t even know if 
you’re still...God, I hope so.  
Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty-
two.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound.

TONY (O.S.)
You know, if it wasn’t for the 
existential terror of staring into 
the literal void of space, I’d say 
I’m feeling a little better today.  
Infection’s run its course, thanks 
to the Blue Meanie back there.  
You’d like her.  She’s very 
practical.  And only a tiny bit 
sadistic.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.

TONY (O.S.)
The fuel cells were cracked during 
battle, but we figured out a way to 
reverse the ion charge.  Bought 
ourselves about 48 hours of flight 
time.  Problem is that was 
about...49 hours ago.  

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.

TONY (O.S.)
Which means, we’re dead in the 
water.  A thousand light years from 
the nearest 7-11.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER.  She pushes it 
back to him.

TONY (O.S.)
Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ 
and potable water ran out two weeks 
ago.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the 
glass, staring into the unknown.

TONY
Pep, I know I said no more 
surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was 
really hoping to pull off one last 
one.  But it looks like...well, you 
know what it looks like. 

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Back to now.  Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.

TONY
Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, 
actually, if you grovel for a 
couple weeks, and then move on with 
enormous guilt...I should probably 
lie down for a minute, rest my 
eyes.  Please know, when I drift 
off, it will be like every day 
lately.  I’m fine, totally fine.  
I’m going to dream about you.  It’s 
always you. 

Tony switches the helmet off.

TIME CUT:

NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.

TIME CUT:

Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair.  Tony slumps, 
completely still.  Nebula gives him his privacy.  

Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.  
Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.  

Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes.  Tony’s 
eyelids flutter.  Finally, he opens them to see...

CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT

STEVE ROGERS shaves.  

He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted.  He’s about to 
tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when...

THE WATER RIPPLES.  Steve stares a beat, puzzled.  Then the 
lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY.

Just then, a sound roars overhead.  Steve turns...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT

THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH.  Then the silhouette of 
THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.

Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch 
a flying woman guide the ship to the ground.

Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.

TIME CUT:

Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.  

TONY
I couldn’t stop him.

STEVE
Neither could we.

TONY
I lost the kid.

STEVE
(unable to say it all)
We...lost...

TONY
Is Pepper...?

5


6

JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS.

PEPPER POTTS
Stay here, you stay right here-

TONY
I’m not going anywhere.

NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans.  ROCKET SITS BESIDE 
HER, GRATEFUL.  She rests a hand on his furry head.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch...

A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE’VE LOST: 
WANDA.  VISION.  BUCKY.  T’CHALLA.  MARIA HILL.  

RHODEY
It’s been twenty-three days since 
Thanos came to Earth.

TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into 
his arm.  He stares, taking in the loss: 

SAM WILSON.  SECRETARY ROSS.  SHARON CARTER.  SCOTT LANG.  
HOPE VAN DYNE.  HANK PYM.  NICK FURY. 

At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.

NATASHA
World governments are in pieces, as 
you can imagine.  But the parts 
that still work are trying to take 
a census.  It looks like he did 
what he said he was going to do.

JANE FOSTER.  ERIK SELVIG.  WONG.  DR. STRANGE.  THE BARTON 
FAMILY.  QUILL.  DRAX.  MANTIS.  GROOT.  PETER PARKER.

Finally, Tony looks away.  RHODEY turns it off.  

NATASHA (CONT'D)
Thanos wiped out fifty percent of 
all the living creatures on Earth.

CAROL DANVERS
Not just Earth. 

RHODEY
You sure about that?

6


7

CAROL DANVERS
You never have to ask me that.

TONY
Where is he now?

STEVE
We don’t know.  He just opened a 
portal and walked through.  

Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.

TONY
What’s his deal? 

ROCKET (O.S.)
He’s pissed.

Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
He thinks he failed.  Which, of 
course, he did.  But there’s a lot 
of that going around, ain’t there?

TONY
Until this second, I literally  
thought you were a Build-a-Bear.

STEVE
We’ve been hunting Thanos for three 
weeks - deep space scans, 
satellites - we got nothing.  Tony, 
you fought him-

TONY
Who told you that?  I didn’t fight 
him, he wiped my face with a planet 
while a Bleecker Street magician 
gave away the store.  There was no 
fight because he’s not beatable. 

STEVE
Did he give you anything to go on?  
Clues, coordinates-  

Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve.

TONY
I saw this coming, few years back. 
Didn’t wanna believe.  I thought I 
was dreaming...  

7


8

STEVE
Tony, I need you to focus-

TONY
And I needed you, as in past tense.  
That trumps what you need.  It’s  
too late, buddy.  You know what I 
need?

Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable.  

TONY (CONT'D)
I need a shave and a burger, not a 
bowl of soup.
(stands)
And I believe I remember telling 
all of you, alive and otherwise, 
that we needed a suit of armor 
around the world, whether it 
impacted our precious freedoms or 
not-

STEVE
But that didn’t work out, did it?

TONY
I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do 
that together, too.”  Guess what, 
Cap, we lost, and you weren’t 
there.  But that’s what we do, 
right?  Our best work after the 
fact?  We’re the “Avengers”, not 
the “Pre-vengers-”

RHODEY
Tony, take it easy...

TONY
I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap.  No 
coordinates, no clues, no 
strategies, no options.  Zero, zip, 
nada.  No trust.
(rips out RT)
Here.  You take this.  You find 
him, you put this on, and hide.
(drops to his knees)
I’m fine!

Tony COLLAPSES.  Rhodey catches him.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY

CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY 
IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE.  

RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM.

RHODEY
Bruce gave him a sedative.  Should 
be out the rest of the day.

CAROL DANVERS
(heading for the lab)
Take care of him.  When I come 
back, I’ll bring a bottle of 
Xorrian elixir.

STEVE
Where are you going?

CAROL DANVERS
To kill Thanos.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP.

NATASHA
Hey, hey, hang on.  We’re sort of a 
team here.  Between you and me, 
morale’s a little fragile.

CAROL DANVERS
Oh, I’m sorry.  My fault.

Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up.  She claps her hands.

CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D)
All right, team!  I’m going to go 
kill Thanos.  Message me if you get 
any intel that can help.  
Otherwise, I’ll report back when 
he’s dead.  Great work, everybody.  

STEVE
Look, we realize “up there’s” more 
your territory, but this is our 
fight, too. 

RHODEY
Do you even know where he is?

9


10

CAROL DANVERS
I know people who might-

NEBULA (O.S.)
Don’t bother.

They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY.

NEBULA (CONT'D)
I can tell you where Thanos is.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY

STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL 
gather.  NEBULA studies her robotic hand.

NEBULA
Thanos spent a long time trying 
to...perfect me.  When he worked, 
he talked.  About his Great Plan.  
Even disassembled, I wanted to 
please him.  I’d ask, where would 
we go once his plan was complete?  
His answer was always the same: “To 
the Garden.”

RHODEY
You’re saying Thanos had a 
retirement plan.

STEVE
Where’s this garden?

ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP.  A BRIGHT SURGE OF 
ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA).

ROCKET
When Thanos snapped his fingers, 
Earth become ground zero for a 
power surge of ridiculously cosmic 
proportions.  No one’s seen 
anything like it.

He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN 
IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Until two days ago.

NATASHA
You’re saying he snapped his 
fingers again.  Where?

10


11

Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars...

NEBULA
Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable.  
Rich atmosphere, good soil-

STEVE
A garden.

BRUCE BANNER
Thanos is there.  And he just used 
the stones.

Steve eyes everyone.  THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP.  

BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D)
(thinking of himself)
You know, we’d be going short-
handed.

RHODEY
Because he killed all our friends.

ROCKET
Are we saying they’re dead?  We’re 
using that word now?

RHODEY
He’s still got the stones.

CAROL DANVERS
So, we take them.  And we use them 
to bring everybody back.

BRUCE BANNER
Just like that?

STEVE
Yeah.  Just like that.

No one speaks.  Finally...

NATASHA
If there’s even the smallest chance 
we can undo this, then we owe it to 
everyone who’s not sitting here to 
try.

Everyone looks around the room...AGREED.

BRUCE BANNER
If we do this...why would it end 
any differently than it did before?

11


12

CAROL DANVERS
Because before you didn’t have me.

RHODEY
Hey, new girl.  All of us in here 
are about that superhero life.  
Where’ve you been all this time?

CAROL DANVERS
There’s a lot of people in the 
universe.  And they didn’t all have 
you.

THOR STANDS.  He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand.  
STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR.

Carol doesn’t flinch.  Thor smiles.

THOR
I like this one.

Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment.  Then...

STEVE
Let’s go get that son of a bitch.

SLAM TO:
TITLE: “AVENGERS: ENDGAME”

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN

EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight 
deck.  STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. 

CAROL DANVERS
Trust me.  You get used to it.

ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair.

ROCKET
Okay, who here hasn’t been to 
space?

STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Oh, you’re gonna hate this.

NEBULA
Approaching jump in three, two...

STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...

12


13

EXT. BENATAR - DAWN

WHOOSH!  THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

WHOOSH!  THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET.  
As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet.

CAROL DANVERS
I’ll head down for recon.  If I’m 
not back in fifteen, you’ll know I 
found him.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense.  

NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY 
CARTER’S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE. 

NATASHA
This is going to work, Steve.

STEVE
I know it will.  
(beat)
Because I don’t know what I’m going 
to do if it doesn’t.

JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM)
No satellites, no ships, no armies.  
No ground defenses of any kind.  
It’s just him.

NEBULA
That’s enough.

The Avengers exchange a look.

EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY

SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE.

INT. THANOS’ LODGE - DAY

A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE.  Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT 
SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened.  A shell of his former self.

13


14

He stirs the pot.  Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE 
FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET...

PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST.

Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE.  CAROL AND 
RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS.  

THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others.  HE 
SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND. 

The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet.  He picks it up...and 
his face goes slack.  He turns the glove toward the others.

And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE.

STEVE
Where are they?

Thanos doesn’t answer.  CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES.

CAROL DANVERS
Answer the question!

THANOS
The universe required correction.  
After that, the stones served no 
purpose beyond temptation.

BRUCE BANNER
You murdered trillions.

THANOS
You should be grateful.

NATASHA
Where are the stones?

THANOS
Gone.  Reduced to atoms.  

BRUCE BANNER
You used them two days ago!

THANOS
I used the stones to destroy the 
stones.  It nearly killed me.
But the work is done.  It always 
will be. 

That lands, sickening.  ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS.

ROCKET
No...they can’t be gone...

14


15

RHODEY
He’s lying. 

NEBULA
My father is many things.  A liar 
is not one of them.

THANOS
Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve 
treated you-

SWOOSH.  THOR’S AXE SEVERS THANOS’ HEAD FROM HIS BODY.  IT 
HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME. 

ROCKET
What did you do?

Thor just stares, his long journey a failure.  

THOR
I went for the head.

As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the 
ground.  IT’S OVER.  THEY LOST.

FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK: “FIVE YEARS LATER.”

EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY

A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi.  THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN 
CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN.

EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY 

A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled 
parking lot.  Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER.

INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS.  
IT READS, “WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY’RE GONE?”

The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.”

15


16

A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP.  

GRIEVING MAN
So, I went on a date the other day. 

JIMMY
Good job, Bobby.  Back in the game.

GRIEVING MAN
Thank you, Jimmy.
(to the group)
First in five years.  I sat there 
at dinner thinking, what are we 
even supposed to talk about? 

STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY.

STEVE
What did you talk about?

GRIEVING MAN
Same old crap.  How much things 
have changed.  How much we miss the 
Mets.  My job, his job.  Then it 
got kind of quiet.  He cried during 
the salads.

OLDER MAN 
What about you?

GRIEVING MAN
I cried just before dessert.  But 
I’m seeing him again tomorrow.  
So...

 STEVE
That’s great.  You’ve already done 
the hardest part.  You took a jump, 
didn’t know where you’d come down.  
And that’s it, those little brave 
baby steps we’ve gotta take.  To 
try to make us feel whole again, to 
find a purpose...
(to everyone)
I went into the ice right after I 
met the love of my life.  Woke up 
seventy years later and...had to 
keep going.

The group takes this in.

16


17

STEVE (CONT'D)
The world’s been left in our hands.  
If we don’t do something with 
it...then Thanos might as well have 
killed all of us.

People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet 
San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY

LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. 
LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.”

THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL.  

A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS.  IT ACCIDENTALLY 
STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN.  FLASH.

THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG,  
ANT-MAN suit shorting.  He retracts his helmet, gasping.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard.  He looks 
up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.”

EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY

A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump.  Scott, in his old 
clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away.  

The Guard watches him go, puzzled.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY

Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES.

SCOTT LANG
Hello?

He hears A CLACKING.  A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing 
card wedged between his spokes. 

Scott waves him down.  The kid stops.

17


18

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Hey.  Kid.  What happened here?

The kid says nothing.  He just stares at Scott with a haunted 
look.  Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park.  A small crowd mills.  Reveal 
Scott looking over the monuments, lost.

TIME CUT:

Scott walks up to the obelisks.  At the top, they read: “THE 
VANISHED.”  Hundreds of names line the stones.

He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.”

SCOTT LANG
What?
(realizing)
Cassie...

EXT. MAGGIE LANG’S HOUSE - DAY

A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house.  
He leaps a bush, banging on the front door.

SCOTT LANG
Cassie!  Cassie!

SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked.  A very long beat.

CASSIE LANG
Dad?

SCOTT LANG
Peanut?

Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years 
older than when he last saw her.  She hugs him, CRYING. 

CASSIE LANG
I thought you were gone.

SCOTT LANG
I’m sorry.  I’m back...I’m 
back...I’m back...

19

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN

Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass.  Rusty 
chains lock the gate.  

Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA.  KEEP OUT.” 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT

NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL 
DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE.

ROCKET (HOLO)
We boarded that “highly suspect 
warship” Danvers pinged.

NATASHA
And?

NEBULA (HOLO)
It was an infectious garbage scow.

ROCKET (HOLO)
So thanks for the hot tip-   

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
You were closer.

ROCKET (HOLO)
And now we smell like garbage-

NATASHA
(to Okoye)
You get a reading on those tremors?

OKOYE (HOLO)
Minor subduction in the African 
plate.

NATASHA
Do we have a visual?  How are you 
handling it?

OKOYE (HOLO)
Nat.  It was a mild earthquake.  In 
the ocean.  We handle it by not 
handling it.

Natasha looks burdened.  Rhodey steps in.

RHODEY (HOLO)
I can have NASA redirect a 
satellite, do a sweep just to make 
sure.

NATASHA
Thanks.  Carol, you’re still coming 
our way next month?

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
Not likely.

ROCKET (HOLO)
Getting another haircut?

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a 
lot of territory out here.  The 
things that have been happening on 
Earth have been happening 
everywhere else.  On thousands of 
planets.  You might not see me for 
a long time.

NATASHA
All right.  Everybody keep keeping 
their eyes open.  This channel’s 
always active.  Anything goes 
sideways, anyone makes trouble 
where they shouldn’t, it comes 
through me.

They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
What’s up?  Where are you?

RHODEY (HOLO)
Mexico.  Got some news. 

NATASHA
Okay...

RHODEY
Federalés found a room full of 
bodies outside Juarez.  Cartel 
guys.  Guns still in their pants.

NATASHA
Could be a rival hit-

RHODEY
But it wasn’t.  Same MO as 
Marseille.  And Kiev.  
(MORE)

RHODEY (CONT'D)

21

(beat)
It’s definitely Barton.

She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
What he’s done here...what he’s 
been doing...I got to tell you, 
part of me doesn’t want to find 
him.    

Natasha just stares a long beat.

NATASHA
Find out where’s he going next.

Rhodey nods, signing off.  Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES.  

After a long beat...

STEVE (O.S.)
I’d offer to cook you dinner but 
you seem sad enough already.

Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway.

NATASHA
Come by to do your laundry?

STEVE
And see a friend.

NATASHA
Your friend’s fine.

STEVE
She leave the house today?

NATASHA
Nothing out there I particularly 
want to see.

STEVE
I spotted a pod of whales coming 
over the bridge.

NATASHA
(dubious)
In the Hudson.

STEVE
Fewer ships, cleaner water.  Just 
saying, there’s still a world out 
there. 

RHODEY (CONT'D)

22

NATASHA
If you’re about to tell me to look 
on the bright side, I’m about to 
hit you with a peanut butter 
sandwich.

Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. 

STEVE
Sorry.  Force of habit.

NATASHA
I don’t know how you do it.

Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich.

STEVE
I guess I don’t know how not to.

NATASHA
Me, neither.

After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. 

STEVE
I keep telling them, move on.  Grow 
past it.  And some of them actually 
do.  But not us.  

NATASHA
If I move on, who does this?

STEVE
Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.

Natasha takes that in.  Steve is thinking of giving up.  She 
looks around at Avengers Compound.

NATASHA
I used to have nothing.  Then I got 
this.  This job, this family.  And 
I was better because of it.

She chokes slightly, collecting herself.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
And even though they’re gone, I’m 
still trying to be...better.  

STEVE
I think we both need to get a life.

NATASHA
You first.

22


23

They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment.

THEN, WE HEAR A PING.  NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY:  
SCOTT LANG’S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS’ VAN BEHIND HIM.  

SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN)
Hello?  Is anyone home?  This is, 
uh, Scott Lang?  We met a few years 
ago.  At the airport?

STEVE
This an old message?

NATASHA
(stunned)
It’s the front gate.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. 

STEVE (O.S.)
Scott, are you okay?

SCOTT LANG
What?  Yes.

He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. 

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Have either of you guys ever 
studied quantum physics?

NATASHA
Only to make conversation.

Steve glances at her.  She shrugs.

SCOTT LANG
Well, five years ago, just before 
this Thanos guy...I went into a 
place called the Quantum Realm.  
It’s like its own microscopic 
universe.  You can only get there 
if you’re incredibly small.  Hope,  
she’s my...she was supposed to pull 
me out.  But then Thanos happened.  
And I was stuck in there.

NATASHA
I’m sorry.  It must’ve been a long 
five years.

23


24

SCOTT LANG
(getting excited)
Okay, but that’s the thing.  It 
wasn’t.  For me, it was only five 
hours.  The rules in the Quantum 
Realm aren’t like out here.  
They’re completely unpredictable. 
Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?

STEVE
Scott, what are you talking about?  

SCOTT LANG
Time works differently in the 
Quantum Realm. 

Steve and Natasha share a look.

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, 
there’s no way to navigate it.  But 
what if we could figure out a way 
to enter the Quantum Realm at a 
certain point in time...and come 
out in another.  Like, before 
Thanos-

STEVE
Wait...wait.  Scott.  Are you 
talking about a time machine?

SCOTT LANG
No, not a machine.  More like a...
(searches, then gives up)
Yeah, like a time machine.  I know 
it sounds crazy...

NATASHA
Scott, I get emails from a raccoon.  
Nothing’s crazy anymore.

SCOTT LANG
So, who do we talk to about this?

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY

TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house.

24


25

TONY
Morgan H. Stark.  Chow time.  Want 
some lunch?

Silence.  Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, 
wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE).

MORGAN STARK
Define lunch or be disintegrated. 

TONY
You should not be wearing that.  
It’s part of a special anniversary 
gift I made for Mom.  You thinking 
about lunch?

Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL.

TONY (CONT'D)
Where’d you find this?

MORGAN STARK
Garage.

Tony picks her up, walking toward the house.

TONY
You like going in the garage?  So 
does Daddy.  It’s all right.  Mommy 
never wears what I buy her.

TIME CUT:

Tony and Morgan exit the woods.  Suddenly, Tony stops.  

In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him.  NATASHA AND 
SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY

STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY.

TONY
I just want to thank you folks for 
dropping by.  It’s not every day 
one gets to contemplate biting it 
on an inter-dimensional timescape. 

NATASHA
You’ve got some objections to the 
plan.

25


26

TONY
So you’re calling it a plan.  To 
me, it sounds like an exotic 
suicide method.  Not to mention, 
it’s impossible. 

SCOTT LANG
We know what it sounds like.  

STEVE
Tony, after what you’ve seen, is 
anything really impossible?

TONY
Quantum fluctuation kinda messes 
with the Planck Scale, which then 
triggers the Deutsch Proposition, 
can we agree on that?  
(offering more tea)
Chai?
(back on message)
In layman’s terms, it means you can 
cancel your Netflix subscription 
because you’re not coming home.

SCOTT LANG
I did.

TONY
Which was a billion-to-one cosmic  
fluke.  Now you want to pull a-  
What are you calling it?

SCOTT LANG
A time heist.

TONY
Oh, of course, a time heist, why 
didn’t we think of this before?  
Right, because it’s a pipe dream.  
Who are you again? 

SCOTT LANG
Still Scott...

STEVE
Tony, the Stones exist in the past.  
We could get them and bring them 
here.  

NATASHA
We can snap our own fingers.  We 
can bring everybody back. 

26


27

TONY
Or screw it up worse than he 
already has.

STEVE
I don’t believe we would.

Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge.

TONY
Gotta say it.  Sometimes I’ve 
missed that giddy optimism.  Sadly, 
all your high hopes won’t help me 
if there’s no logical, tangible way 
for me to safely execute said “time 
heist.”  I believe the most likely 
outcome would be our collective 
demise.

SCOTT LANG
Not if we strictly follow the rules 
of time travel.  No talking to our 
past selves.  No betting on 
sporting events-

TONY
Stop, Scott.  Stop.  Are you 
telling me that your plan to save 
the universe is more than loosely 
based on Back to the Future?

SCOTT LANG
(meaning “yes”)
No...

TONY
Good.  Because that would be 
horseshit.  Scientifically 
speaking, your brother’s picture 
doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you 
went to the dance with your mom. 
That’s not how quantum physics 
works.

NATASHA
We have to take a stand.  

TONY
We did stand.  And yet here we are.  

SCOTT LANG
Look, Stark-  Can I call you Tony?

27


28

TONY
Please don’t-

SCOTT LANG
Tony-

TONY
Fine.

SCOTT LANG
I get that you’ve got a lot on the 
line, here.  You’ve got a wife.  A 
daughter.  But I lost someone very 
important - a lot of us did - and 
now we have a chance to save her, 
and everyone else, and you won’t 
even- 

TONY
No, Scott.  I won’t.  Even.   

Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch.

MORGAN STARK
Mommy told me to come save you.

Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. 

TONY
Good job.  I’m saved.
(to Steve)
I wish you were coming here to ask 
me something else.  I’m honestly 
happy to see you.  If you want to 
stay-

Steve tries one last time.

STEVE
Tony, I get it.  And I’m happy for 
you.  I am.  But this is a second 
chance.

TONY
Yeah, well, I got my second chance 
right here.  I can’t roll the dice 
on it.  The table is set for six.  
If you don’t talk shop, you’re 
welcome to stay for lunch.

He exits. 

28


29

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY

Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car.

NATASHA
He’s scared.

STEVE
He’s not wrong.

SCOTT LANG
What are we gonna do?  We need him. 
You want to stop?

STEVE
No.  I want to do it right.  
(beat)
We’re going to need a really big 
brain.

SCOTT LANG
Bigger than his?

EXT. DINER - NIGHT

ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside.

SCOTT LANG (O.S.)
I’m confused.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. 
SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM.  

SMART HULK
These are confusing times.

SCOTT LANG
No, that’s not what I’m-

SMART HULK
I’m kidding, I get it.  It’s crazy.  
I wear shirts now!

SCOTT LANG
But why?

SMART HULK
Five years ago, we got our asses 
kicked, right?

29

---


30

Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites.

STEVE
He’s heard.

SMART HULK
It was worse for me.  Because I 
lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then 
Banner lost.  Then we all lost.

NATASHA
No one blamed you, Bruce.

SMART HULK
I did-  I feel like I’m the only 
one eating.  Here, try some.

He holds out a pizza.  They decline.  He shrugs.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Thing is, I kept thinking, it 
didn’t have to be that way.  That 
the best of Banner and best of 
Hulk, if they’d worked together, 
maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos.  

SCOTT LANG
Okay.  But how did...this happen?

SMART HULK
For years I treated the Hulk like a 
disease, something to get rid of.  
But when I started treating him 
like the cure...

Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab.  
I put the brains and the brawn 
together.  And now look at me.  
Best of both worlds.

TWO KIDS amble up to the booth.

KID
Mr. Hulk?  Can we get a picture?

SMART HULK
100%, little lady.

The kid hands a phone to Steve.  SMART HULK makes a duck face 
as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.

30


31

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
(to the fan)
Thanks, pal.  Hulk out!

STEVE
So, Bruce, about what we said-

SMART HULK
The time travel do-over?  I don’t 
know, that’s kind of outside my 
field of expertise...

Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them.

NATASHA
You pulled this off.  I remember a 
time that was impossible, too.

He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone.

SMART HULK
I’m supposed to be on Oprah next 
week, but I guess I could move 
things around.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT

TONY STARK DOES DISHES.  He rinses with the sprayer.  It goes 
everywhere.  He wipes down the counter, including...

A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER.  He stares.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT

Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes.  He 
studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued.

TONY
Friday, you up? 

FRIDAY
Yes, sir. 

TONY
I’ve had a mild inspiration, like 
to see if it checks out.  I would 
like to run one last sim before we 
pack it in for the night.  This 
time, in the shape of a Mobius 
Strip, inverted.

31


32

FRIDAY
Processing.

The model forms.

TONY
All right, give me the eigenvalue 
of that particle, factoring in 
spectral decomp.  Run it.  That’ll 
take a second.  And don’t worry if 
it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind 
of...

THE CAPACITOR GLOWS.  A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR 
WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT.  

FRIDAY
Model rendered.

TONY
(in awe)
Shit.

MORGAN STARK (O.S.)
Shit.

Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway.

TONY
What are you doing up?

MORGAN STARK
Shit.

TONY
First of all, that’s a Mommy word, 
she coined it.  

MORGAN STARK
Why are you up?

TONY
I just had something on my mind.

MORGAN STARK
Was it juice pops?

TONY
Correct.  Great minds think alike. 
What kind do you want?

32


33

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed.  Tony watches.

TONY
You done?  
(finishing her popsicle)
Now you are. 

MORGAN STARK
Tell me a story.

TONY
Once upon a time, Maguna went to 
bed.  The end.

MORGAN STARK
That was a bad story.

He runs his hand over her hair.

TONY
Love you tons.

MORGAN STARK
Love you three thousand.

TONY
Wow, that’s a lot. 

Tony turns out the light, exits.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony.  Even one of 
HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL.  

Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading.  Then... 

TONY (O.S.)
Out like a light.  Don’t know how 
much she loves you but she loves me 
three thousand.

PEPPER POTTS
That’s up there.

TONY
What’re you reading?

PEPPER POTTS
A book about composting-

33


34

TONY
I think I solved it.

Pepper looks up.

PEPPER POTTS
Just so we’re both talking about 
the same thing-

TONY
Time travel.

PEPPER POTTS
That’s amazing.

TONY
Yeah.  

PEPPER POTTS
And terrifying.  

TONY
To say the least.

He sits beside her.  She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA.

PEPPER POTTS
We got really lucky-  

TONY
I know-

PEPPER POTTS
Not everybody did.

TONY
I can’t help everybody.

PEPPER POTTS
Except, it sort of seems like you 
can.

TONY
Not if I stopped right here.  

PEPPER POTTS
Tony, trying to get you to stop is 
one of the few failures of my life.

TONY
I could just lock the lab, put it 
in a trunk, sink it to the bottom 
of the lake, and go to bed.

34


35

PEPPER POTTS
But could you rest?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE 
OPEN VAN DOORS.  

SCOTT LANG
You’re sure these modifications are 
safe?

He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, 
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL.  

SMART HULK
I reran my calculations three times-

SCOTT LANG
Because the guy who invented this 
thing is pretty much a genius-

SMART HULK
I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans 
Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m 
personal friends with Bill Nye the 
Science Guy.  We’re good. 

SCOTT LANG
Yeah.  And you look like that on 
purpose.

STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside.

STEVE
Breakers are set, emergency 
generator’s on stand-by.

SMART HULK
Good.  If we blow the grid, I don’t 
want to lose Tiny back in the 
‘50’s.

SCOTT LANG
Excuse me?

NATASHA
He was kidding.

SMART HULK
I was kidding.

35


36

NATASHA
(to Hulk)
You were kidding, right?

SMART HULK
Honestly, I have no idea.  We’re 
attempting time travel.  Either 
it’s all a joke, or none of it is.
(loudly to Scott)
We’re good!  Helmet on.

Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Okay.  I’m going to send you back 
one week, give you an hour to look 
around, then bring you back in ten 
seconds.  Make sense?  

SCOTT LANG
Perfectly not confusing.

STEVE
Good luck, Scott.  You’ve got this.

SCOTT LANG
(inspired)
Yes, I do, Captain America.  Yes, I-

SMART HULK PULLS A LEVER.  SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. 

SMART HULK
Counting down from three, two, 
one...

SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD.

SCOTT LANG
Uh, guys?  This doesn’t feel right.

NATASHA
Is that Scott?

SMART HULK
Probably...?

He scrambles, hitting buttons.  SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.

STEVE
Get him back!

Smart Hulk flips a switch.  SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93.

36


37

SCOTT LANG
Oh, my back!

NATASHA
Bruce!  Get it under control.  What 
the hell is going on? 

SMART HULK
I got it, I know exactly what’s 
going on.  Pretty much.

SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN.  HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with 
A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys.

2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS.

NATASHA
Oh, my God.

STEVE
It’s a baby.

SMART HULK
It’s Scott.

STEVE
As a baby!

Smart Hulk hits a button.  Baby Scott disappears.

SMART HULK
When I tell you, kill the power!
(throwing a switch)
Now!

NATASHA KILLS THE POWER.  Normal Scott stumbles off the pad.

SCOTT LANG
Somebody peed my pants.  I don’t 
know if it was baby-me or old-me. 
Or just me-me.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

Steve leans on the wall, discouraged.  Then he hears AN 
ENGINE ROAR.  AN AUDI races up the drive.  

It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY.

TONY
Why the long face?  Wild guess, he 
turned into a baby?

37


38

STEVE
Among other things.

TONY
(getting out of the car)
EPR Paradox.  Instead of pushing 
Lang through time, you were pushing 
time through Lang.  It’s dangerous.  
I probably should’ve cautioned you 
against it.

STEVE
You did.

TONY
Thank god, I’m here.  Regardless, I 
fixed it.

He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR.

TONY (CONT'D)
That is a fully-functioning, time-
space GPS.  I just want peace. 
Resentment is corrosive.  I hate 
it. 

STEVE
Me, too.

Something eases between them, for the first time in years.

TONY
We’ve got a shot at the Stones.  I 
just need you to know my 
priorities.  Bring back everyone we 
lost, hopefully.  Keep what I 
found, definitely.  And, let’s not 
die trying. 

Steve looks at Tony.  Finally, he offers his hand.

STEVE
Sounds like a deal.

They shake.  This is a long time coming.  Finally...

TONY
But wait, there’s more.   Act now, 
and it comes with a bonus offer.

Tony pops the trunk.  Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD.  

STEVE
Tony, I don’t know-

38


39

TONY
What’s to know?  He made it for 
you.  Plus, I gotta get it out of 
the garage before Morgan takes it 
sledding. 

Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM.

STEVE
Thank you, Tony. 

Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk.

TONY
Just don’t flaunt it.  I didn’t 
bring enough for the whole team.
We are getting the whole team, 
right?

STEVE
We’re trying.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco.  THEN A 
MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away.

THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND.  NEBULA AND 
ROCKET EMERGE.  Rocket waits at the end of the gangway.

ROCKET
Hey, Humie.  Where’s Big Green?

SCOTT LANG
Um, kitchen, I think.

Scott tries a smile at Nebula.  She just hits her COM:

NEBULA (INTO COM)
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.  
There’s an idiot in the landing 
zone.

She goes in.  THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. 

SCOTT LANG
Oh, my God!

RHODEY
What’s up, Regular-Sized Man?

Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an 
overnight bag.  He hands Scott some tacos.

39


40

ROCKET
Finally.  I ain’t got all day.

SMART HULK
I call shotgun!

As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC 
SCRAPING SOUND.

EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY

The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE.  
Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. 

A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND 
ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY

SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN.  ASGARDIANS IN 
EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION.

ROCKET
What the heck are they looking at?

SMART HULK
I’m kind of famous...

ROCKET
Yeah, I’m sure that’s it.  Kind of 
a step down from golden palaces and 
magic hammers...

SMART HULK
They lost Asgard, then half their 
people.  Maybe they’re just happy 
to have a home.

VALKYRIE (O.S.)
You shouldn’t have come.

VALKYRIE approaches from the pier.  Smart Hulk GRINS.

SMART HULK
Hey, Valkyrie!  Great to see you!

He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T.  She studies the new him.

VALKYRIE
Uh huh.  I liked you better either 
of the other ways.

40


41

SMART HULK
This is Rocket.

ROCKET
Hey.

VALKYRIE
Hey.
(to both)
He won’t see you.

SMART HULK
We didn’t say we were here to see-

VALKYRIE
Great, then you can hose out the 
gut buckets-

ROCKET
We’re definitely here to see him.

VALKYRIE
He can’t give you what you need.

SMART HULK
It’s that bad?

VALKYRIE
We only see him once a month.  When 
he comes in for “supplies.”

She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY

Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN.  Nothing.

INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY

SMART HULK opens the door.  PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES 
litter the floor.  Rocket recoils.

ROCKET
Something died in here.  

SMART HULK
Hello...?  Thor...?

THOR (O.S.)
Are you here about the cable?

We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.

41


42

THOR (CONT'D)
Cinemax went out two days ago, and 
the sports are all...fuzzy...

THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND 
TREMENDOUSLY FAT.  Rocket and Hulk stare.

SMART HULK
Thor?

THOR
BROS!  Bring it in!

Thor hugs Smart Hulk.  He turns to Rocket, who steps back.  

ROCKET
Yeah, I’m good.

THOR
Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and 
Miek, right?

KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4.

KORG
Beer’s in the bucket.  Feel free to 
log on to the WiFi.

SMART HULK
Hey, guys.  Long time no-

KORG
Thor!  This kid on the TV just 
called me a dickhead!  

THOR
Noobmaster again?

KORG
NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead-

Thor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic.

THOR
Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. 
God of Thunder.  This is your last 
warning.  Log off this game or I 
will come to your basement, rip off 
your arms and shove them up your 
butt.
(handing the headset back)
Right, who wants a drink?

42


(MORE)

43

SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE.  Thor pulls a beer from the 
fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER.

SMART HULK
Hey, buddy, are you all right?

THOR
Don’t I look all right?

ROCKET
(under his breath)
You look like melted ice cream-

THOR
So, what’s up?  Just here for a 
hang?

SMART HULK
We need your help.  There’s a 
chance we can fix everything.

THOR
Like the cable?  It’s driving me 
bananas.

SMART HULK
Like Thanos.

THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE.  KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH.

THOR
Don’t say that name. 

KORG
Yeah, we don’t say that name in 
here.

Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT.

SMART HULK
Please take your hand off me.

Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Now, I know the thought of...that 
guy might scare you-

THOR
Scared?  Why would I be scared of 
that guy?  I’m the one who killed 
that guy, remember? 
(looking around)
Anyone else here kill that guy? 
(MORE)

43


THOR (CONT'D)

44

Didn’t think so.  Korg, tell 
everyone who chopped Thanos’ head 
off.

KORG
Stormbreaker?

Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle.  BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND.  
Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING.

THOR
Not.  Cool.  Man.

ROCKET
Don’t.  Care.  Dude.

SMART HULK
Look, I get it.  You’re in a rough 
patch.  I’ve been there.  But you 
know who helped me out of it?

THOR
Was it Natasha?

SMART HULK
It was you.  You helped me.  And I 
need you to help me again.

THOR
Ask the Asgardians down there how 
much “my help” is worth.  

ROCKET
At least they’re alive-

THOR
They were gods!  Now they’re 
fisherpeople!
(sagging into a chair)
The ones that are left, anyway.

SMART HULK
That’s the thing.  I think we can 
bring them back.

Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head.

THOR
Stop.  Stop.  I know you think I’m 
down here, wallowing in my own self-
pity, waiting to be rescued.  But 
I’m fine.  I’m happy.  Whatever it 
is you’re offering, don’t care.  
Couldn’t care less.

THOR (CONT'D)

Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor.  

SMART HULK
Come on, pal.  We need you.

He still can’t meet their gaze.  Finally...

ROCKET
There’s beer in the ship.

THOR
(beat)
What kind?

EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT

A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS.

BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH 
OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS.  

TITLE: “TOKYO.”

AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING.  
A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON.

KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT 
WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. 

WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE.

PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, 
RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET.

ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT...

WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, 
TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE.

CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES 
OFF THE STAIRS AS...

A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS 
TELESCOPING BLADE.

BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE 
FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG.  THEN...  

CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  THUD.  

WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING.  
GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS...

45


46

SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, 
AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK...

LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP.  HE ROLLS TO 
THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE.

THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING 
OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW.

RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN.  HARD-SET EYES 
STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK.  THEY BATTLE. 

AKIHIKO
(Japanese, subtitled)
Why are you doing this?  We never 
did anything to you!

RONIN
(Japanese, subtitled)
You survived.  Half the planet 
didn’t.  They got Thanos.  You get 
me.  

Akihiko attacks.  Ronin slashes him across the middle.

RONIN (CONT'D)
(Japanese, subtitled)
You’re done hurting people.

Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street.

AKIHIKO
We hurt people?  You’re crazy.

Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat.  The man drops to his knees.

AKIHIKO (CONT'D)
Wait!  Help me!  I’ll give you 
anything!  What do you want?

RONIN
What I want...you can’t give me.

Ronin finishes him off.  AKIHIKO GOES STILL.  SIRENS WAIL.  
Ronin removes his mask, revealing...

CLINT BARTON, haggard.  He hears A FOOTFALL.  He whirls, 
katana raised...then stops.  His face goes slack as...  

NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA 
KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN.  

They stare at each other.  Clint hasn’t seen her in years.  
She hasn’t seen what he’s become.

CLINT BARTON
You shouldn’t be here.

NATASHA
Neither should you.

CLINT BARTON
I’ve got a job to do.

NATASHA
That what you’re calling this?

She moves even closer.  He stiffens.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
Killing these people isn’t going to 
bring your family back.
(beat)
We found something.  A chance, 
maybe...

CLINT BARTON
Don’t.

NATASHA
Don’t what?

CLINT BARTON
Give me hope.

NATASHA
I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it 
sooner.

CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM 
TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR.

TONY (O.S.)
Out of the way, Lebowski.

Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past.  

TONY (CONT'D)
Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in 
there?

ROCKET (O.S.)
It’s Rocket, and shut up.  You’re 
only a genius on Earth, pal.

47


48

TONY
And you’re only in there because 
you have tiny hands.

ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH.

ROCKET
Fixed it.  

TONY
Thank you.

ROCKET
Get used to saying that.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT.  NEBULA 
ASSISTS.  RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit.

RHODEY
Time travel suit, I like it.

SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES 
INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT.  

SCOTT LANG
Easy, easy.  Careful with those.

SMART HULK
I’m being very careful-

SCOTT LANG
You’re being very Hulky-

Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
These are Pym Particles.  You can’t 
shrink to the Quantum Realm without 
them, and since Hank Pym got 
snapped out of existence, we can’t 
make any more.  I told you.  We’ve 
only got enough for one round trip 
each, no do-overs.

Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.  

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Plus two test runs-

SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK.  He 
takes that in...

48


49

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
One test run.
(embarrassed)
Okay, maybe I’m not ready.

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
I’m game.

They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
I’ll do it.

TIME CUT:

NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT.  Scott looks on, sulky.  
SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing.

SMART HULK
Okay, Clint, you might feel a 
little disoriented when you 
chronoshift-

RHODEY
Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can 
do this, why don’t we just go find 
baby Thanos and, you know...

Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE.

SMART HULK
Uh, one, because that’s horrible.  
And, two, killing baby Thanos 
doesn’t kill adult Thanos.  Time 
doesn’t work like that.  You can’t 
change the future by changing the 
past.

SCOTT LANG
Sure, we can.  We take the stones 
before Thanos gets them, then he 
doesn’t have them.  Problem solved.

NEBULA
That’s not how it works.

CLINT BARTON
I don’t know.  That is kind of what 
I’ve heard-

SMART HULK
Heard from who?  

49


50

RHODEY
Star Trek.  Terminator.  Bill and 
Ted’s Excellent- 

SMART HULK
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS?  
THAT’S NOT TRUE.  IF YOU TRAVEL TO 
THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME 
YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER 
PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH 
NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW 
FUTURE!

NEBULA
Exactly.

RHODEY
Excuse me?

Scott leans over, whispering:

SCOTT LANG
Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.

CLINT BARTON
Look, are we doing this or not?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT.

SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, 
NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on.

SMART HULK
Okay, Clint.  Starting in three, 
two, one...

Clint nods over at them, determined.  SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, 
SHRINKS, AND VANISHES.  WHOOSH. 

EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY

Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor.  ENERGY 
FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT.  

He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME. 

50


51

EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY

Clint climbs the porch.  He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL 
MITT.  Then he hears VOICES.  

He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR.  From the 
sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. 

HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS.  Clint’s face crumples.  Just then...HIS 
QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES.  A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03.

CLINT BARTON
No.  Not yet...
(opening the door)
LILA!

BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW.  0.01-  CLINT VANISHES.  THE 
SCREEN DOOR SLAMS.  After a moment, LILA runs in.

LILA BARTON
Dad?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN.  TONY and NATASHA approach.  

NATASHA
Are you all right?  Hey, look at 
me.  You okay?

TONY
Tell me something good...

Clint looks up, tearful.  He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT.  

CLINT BARTON
It worked.  It worked.

Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and 
Rocket, looking on.

ROCKET
Holy crap.  We’re freaking time 
travelers.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO)

On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.”  
Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: 

LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, 
THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.

51


52

STEVE
Okay.  Now that we’ve got how, 
we’re going to need where and when.

NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and 
CLINT look on.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Most folks here have encountered at 
least one of the six Infinity 
Stones-

TONY
I think you mean nearly been killed 
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

SCOTT LANG
I haven’t.
(off their looks)
Just...saying.

SMART HULK
Regardless, we’ve only got enough 
Pym Particles for one round trip, 
each.  And the Stones have been in 
a lot of places throughout history.   

TONY
Our history.  Not all of them are 
going to be a fun drop-in.

CLINT BARTON
Which means we’ve got to pick our 
targets.

STEVE
Exactly.
(he taps “REALITY”)
Let’s start with the Aether.  Thor, 
what do we know?

Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over.

NATASHA
Is he asleep?

RHODEY
I’m pretty sure he’s dead. 

DISSOLVE TO:

THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY”     
Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”

THOR
The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more 
of an angry sludge.  My grandfather 
hid it from Dark Elves in a rock 
between dimensions that can only be 
accessed every 5000 years.

HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction.  Thor 
bangs his head, resetting his eye.

THOR (CONT'D)
Or...by Jane.  She stuck her hand 
in a rock.  Then the Aether stuck 
itself inside her.  Then I took her 
to Asgard.  We were dating... 
(depressed)
We’re not anymore.

Everyone stares.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 2 - DAY (MOCO)

listed: “MORAG ?-2014, KYLN 2014, XANDAR 2014-2018.”

FIND ROCKET AS HE SLURPS FROM A CONTAINER OF LO MEIN.

ROCKET
Quill said he stole the Power Stone 
from Morag.  

He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT 
OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.”

SMART HULK
That’s a person?

ROCKET
It’s a planet.  Quill was a person.

SCOTT LANG
Wait, like a planet...in space?

Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek.

ROCKET
Aw, look.  It’s like a puppy, all 
happy and everything.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY

Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit 
quietly, listening to Nebula.

NEBULA
Thanos found the Soul Stone on 
Vormir.

NATASHA
And that is...?

NEBULA
A dominion of death at the very 
center of celestial existence.
(beat)
It’s the place where Thanos 
murdered my sister.

That hangs heavily.  A moment passes.  Then...

SCOTT LANG
Not it.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY

Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out.

NATASHA
So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what 
kind of doctor was he?

SMART HULK
Strange?

TONY
Cross between ear-nose-and-throat 
and rabbit-from-hat.

SMART HULK
Had a nice place in the Village. 

TONY
Yeah.  Sullivan Street.

pick the right year and there were 
three stones in New York. 

SMART HULK
(beat)
Shut the front door...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY

STEVE blocks our view. 

STEVE
Okay, we have a plan.  Six stones, 
three teams, one shot.

He steps away, revealing the board...

EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO 
FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES.  IT’S INSANE.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN 

DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS.  OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN 
THEIR TIME SUITS.

STEVE (O.S.)
Five years ago, we lost.  All of 
us.  

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM. 

STEVE
We lost friends.  We lost family.  
We lost a part of ourselves.
(beat)
But today we have a chance to take 
it all back.

Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT 
& CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.

55


56

STEVE (CONT'D)
You have your teams and you have 
assignments.  Get your stone, and 
get back here.  One round trip 
each.  No mistakes.  No do-overs.  

He grips HIS SHIELD.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Most of us are going back to places 
we know.  That doesn’t mean we know 
what to expect.  Be careful.  Look 
out for each other.  Improvise, if 
you have to.
(looking around)
This is the fight of our lives.  
And we’re going to win.  
(beat)
Whatever it takes. 

The platform stays quiet.  Rocket WHISPERS to Scott:

ROCKET
He’s pretty good at that...

Scott nods enthusiastically. 

TONY
(to Smart Hulk)
All right, you heard the man. 
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL.  LIGHTS 
ILLUMINATE EACH PAD.

SMART HULK
Tracking beacons engaged.  

Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside.

ROCKET
You promise to bring that thing 
back in one piece?

CLINT BARTON
Yeah, sure thing.  I’ll do my best.

ROCKET
That’s pretty lame, as far as 
promises go.

SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP.  
THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE.  NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.

56


57

NATASHA
See you in a minute.

SMART HULK
Actually, it’ll be closer to seven 
or eight microseconds, give or-

SUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY.  WHOOSH. 

THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING.  HULK’S PENCIL SLOWLY 
ROLLS TOWARD THE EDGE...AND DROPS OFF-

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

At the same time, just a block away...

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)

FLASH!  STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the 
mouth of an alley, just out of sight.

TONY
Okay, Park Avenue’s that way.  
Let’s huddle up.  Suits off.

They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS. 

STEVE
We’ve all got our assignments.  Two 
stones uptown, one stone down.  
Stay low, keep an eye on time-  

Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS.

STEVE (CONT'D)
And Bruce?  Maybe smash a few 
things along the way.  For 
appearances.

SMART HULK
(taking off his shirt)
All right, but I have to say, it 
seems gratuitous.

He half-heartedly smashes a few cars.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Grrr...grrr...

EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES.  CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER 
THE VILLAGE.  SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE.  

ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls 
jagged mandalas into the sky.  

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS.  He heads 
for a door, but...

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I’d be careful going that way...

He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
We just had the floors waxed.

SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER.

SMART HULK
Hulk...does what...Hulk want?

ANCIENT ONE
Yes, I suppose that would be the 
case-

JUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI 
CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF.  HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY.

Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish.  The Ancient One looks at him. 

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Care to explain?

SMART HULK
I’m looking for Dr. Strange.

ANCIENT ONE
You’re about five years too early.  
Stephen Strange is currently 
performing surgery, 20 blocks that 
way.  What do you want with him?

He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK.

SMART HULK
Well, that, actually.

58


59

ANCIENT ONE
Ah.  I’m afraid not.

SMART HULK
I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t 
asking.

Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in.  She smiles.

ANCIENT ONE
You don’t want to do this.

SMART HULK
You’re right, I don’t.  But I need 
that stone, and I don’t have a lot 
of time to debate it-

He reaches for it.  THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS 
CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK.

“ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart 
Hulk body.  He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed.

ASTRAL BANNER
No, no, no-

She topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger.  Whump.

ANCIENT ONE
Now.  Let’s start over, shall we?

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)

AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A 
GREEN DRESS.

MAIDEN (O.S.)
For you, Lady Jane.

JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
Um, do you have anything 
with...pants?

MAIDEN (O.S.)
Pants?

JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
It’s okay.  Nevermind.  

Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt.  
Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.  

59


60

THOR
That’s Jane.

ROCKET
Okay, here’s the deal.  You’re 
going to charm her, and I’m going 
to poke her with this thing, 
extract the Reality Stone, and get 
gone lickety-split.

Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious.

THOR
Um, I’ll be right back.  The wine 
cellar is just down here.  My 
father used to have this barrel of 
Aakonian ale.  Felt like getting 
hit in the face with a poleaxe. 
I’ll see if the scullery has a 
couple of to-go cups-

They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING.  Rocket yanks Thor back 
as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR.  

FRIGGA
Send Loki some soup.  I don’t think 
he’s eating.  And ask our 
librarians to pull some volumes 
from the astronomy shelves.  He 
won’t read them, but at least 
they’ll keep him company.

Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall.

ROCKET
Who’s the fancy broad?

THOR
My mother.  She dies today.

ROCKET
Oh, jeez.

Thor starts to sweat.

THOR
I can’t do this.  This is a bad 
idea.  I can’t do this...

Rocket climbs onto a marble monument.

ROCKET
Come here.

Thor steps closer.  ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
You think you’re the only one who’s 
lost people?  What do you think 
we’re doing here?  I lost the only 
family I ever had.  Quill, Groot, 
Drax, the chick with the antenna.  
All gone.  I’ve lived five 
meaningless years without them, and 
every minute has blown Aaskvarian 
gornads.  I get you miss your mom.  
But she’s gone.  Really gone.  
There are plenty of people who are 
only kind of gone.  And you can 
help them.  So, is it too much to 
ask that you brush the crumbs out 
of your beard, make shmoopy talk to 
Prettypants, and when she’s not 
looking, suck out the Infinity 
Stone, and help me get my family 
back? 

Thor stares at him a long moment.  He wipes his tears away.

THOR
I guess not.  

ROCKET
Good.

THOR
Thank you.  I can do this.

ROCKET
Great.

As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself.

THOR
I can do this...I can do this...
(beat)
I can’t do this...

ROCKET

All right, heartbreaker.  This is

THROATS.  THE TWO HUGE SOLDIERS DROP...

REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister.  Beat.

GAMORA
You’re welcome?

BAD NEBULA
I didn’t ask for your help.

GAMORA
And yet you always need it.  Father 
wants us back on the ship.

Gamora offers her hand.  Bad Nebula stands on her own.

BAD NEBULA
Why?

GAMORA
He’s found an Infinity Stone.

Off Bad Nebula’s intrigued look...

INT. Q-SHIP - DAY

BAD NEBULA and GAMORA study a holo-map.

BAD NEBULA
Where?

GAMORA
On a planet called “Morag.”

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY

A DARK FIGURE ADVANCES ACROSS THE SMOKY FIELD, RELENTLESS. 

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
Father’s plan is finally in motion.

GAMORA (O.S.)
One stone isn’t six.

ALIENS RUN FOR COVER, SCREAMING.  SOMETHING CUTS THEM DOWN...

64


65

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
It’s a start.  If he gets them 
all...

THANOS steps from the smoke, armored, wielding A HUGE BLADE.  

GAMORA (O.S.)
We’ll never have to do this again.

THREE ALIENS CHARGE HIM.  THANOS CUTS THEM DOWN.  He wipes 
blood from his face, and SMILES.

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
He’ll miss it.

A SMALL FIGHTER FLIES IN, STRAFING HIM.  NEVER BREAKING 
STRIDE, THANOS SLICES IT IN TWO. 

He looks up to his ship.  A BEAM BATHES HIM IN LIGHT...

INT. Q-SHIP - DAY

Bad Nebula and Gamora turn as THANOS ENTERS THE FLIGHT DECK.  

THANOS
Ronan has located the Power Stone.  
I’m dispatching you to his ship.

GAMORA
He won’t like it.

Thanos wipes the blood from his blade.

THANOS
His alternative is death.  Ronan’s 
obsession clouds his judgement.  
After Loki, I’m taking no chances.

BAD NEBULA
We will not fail you, father.

Thanos finally lays his eyes on her.

THANOS
No.  You won’t.

BAD NEBULA
I swear I will make you proud-

SUDDENLY, BAD NEBULA STAGGERS, hand to the wall.

GAMORA
Sister, what’s-

65


66

Thanos watches, curious, as NEBULA DROPS TO A KNEE.  
SUDDENLY, A HOLO-PROJECTION OF RHODEY BEAMS FROM HER EYE.

RHODEY (HOLO)
So, all we have to do is hang out, 
wait for this Quill guy, and follow 
him to the Power Stone, right?

NEBULA (HOLO) (O.S)
Let’s take cover.  We’re not the 
only ones in this reality looking 
for the stones.

BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection.  Gamora goes to 
her, trying to prop her up.

GAMORA
Who was that?

BAD NEBULA
I...don’t know.  My 
head...splitting...

Bad Nebula winces.  Gamora looks to Thanos.

GAMORA
Her synaptic drive was probably 
damaged in battle- 

THANOS
Sshhh...

Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula.  He gently lifts her head 
with his blade.  Something’s not right. 

THANOS (CONT'D)
Bring her to my ship.

EXT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1) 

Tony swoops onto the helipad outside the wrecked penthouse.

INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

THE MIND STONE GLOWS IN LOKI’S SCEPTER.  Pull back to see 
it’s in A1 NATASHA’S HANDS, as she stands with...

A1 THOR, A1 STEVE, A1 TONY, A1 HULK, AND A1 CLINT (THE ICONIC 
SHOT FROM AVENGERS 1), all staring down at...LOKI.

66


67

LOKI
If it’s all the same to you...I’ll 
have that drink now.

From behind cover, TONY PEERS AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
AVENGERS TABLEAU.

TONY (INTO COM)
Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit 
does nothing for your ass.

STEVE (OVER COM)
No one asked you to look, Tony.

REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY’S SHOULDER.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I think you look great, Cap.  As 
far as I’m concerned, that’s 
America’s ass.

A1 NATASHA
Who gets the magic wand?

A1 STEVE
SHIELD’s coming up now.

TONY
Ball’s in play.  Head’s up, Cap.

From hiding, Tony eyes A1 NATASHA WITH LOKI’S SCEPTER.

INTERCUT:

INT. STARK TOWER, HALLWAY - DAY

STEVE negotiates an empty hallway, head on a swivel.  He 
heads for AN ELEVATOR.

TONY (OVER COM)
Mind Stone’s on the move.

STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m in position.

INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 NATASHA hands LOKI’S SCEPTER to...AGENT SITWELL.  He’s 
about to touch the tip when...

A1 NATASHA
Careful with that.

67


68

A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony’s bar.

A1 CLINT BARTON
Unless you want your mind erased.  
And not in the fun way.

Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A 
STRIKE TEAM WAITS.  BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.”

BROCK RUMLOW
We promise to be extra careful.

Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. 

SCOTT LANG
Who are these guys? 

TONY
SHIELD.  Actually, Hydra.  But we 
didn’t know that yet. 

SCOTT LANG
Seriously?  ‘Cause it’s kind of 
obvious they’re bad guys. 

TONY
You’re small but you’re talking 
loud.

A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m on my way down to coordinate 
search and rescue.

Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE.

LOKI/STEVE
“I’m on my way down to coordinate 
search and rescue.”  I mean, 
really, how do you keep your food 
down?

Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM.  

A1 THOR
Yes, that’s much better.

He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR.

A1 THOR (CONT'D)
You coming, Stark?

68


69

Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE 
TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE.  

A1 TONY
One sec, just packing my lunch.

TONY
All right, you’re up, Little Buddy.  
There’s our stone

A1 Tony crosses to the elevator.  Scott takes position, 
readying himself.

SCOTT LANG
All right.  Flick me.

Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the 
ATTACHE CASE.

TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around 
him as he falls.

A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator.  Then...

A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR.  Avengers 
smile awkwardly.  There’s no room. 

A1 HULK
(angrily)
Hulk take stairs.

EXT. STARK TOWER - DAY

Tony circles around the building...PASSING THE DESCENDING 
SERVICE ELEVATOR, CROWDED WITH RUMLOW’S STRIKE TEAM.

TONY (O.S.)
Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just 
passing the 80th floor.

STEVE (O.S.)
Got it.  Head to the lobby.

TONY (O.S.)
Already on my way.

INT. STARK TOWER, SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

Sitwell, Rumlow, and the STRIKE TEAM descend.

69


70

AGENT SITWELL (INTO PHONE)
Evidence secured, we are en route 
to Dr. List...No, no hitches at 
all, Mr. Secretary...  

The car stops.  The doors open...AND OUR STEVE GETS ON.  

AGENT SITWELL (CONT'D)
Captain, I thought you were 
coordinating search and rescue?

STEVE
Change of plans.

Steve glances at Rumlow, who’s holding THE SCEPTER. 

BROCK RUMLOW
Cap.

STEVE
Rumlow. 

The doors close.  Everyone rides in silence.  Tension mounts.

STEVE (CONT'D)
I got a call from the Secretary’s 
office.  I’m going to be running 
point on the scepter.

Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. 

AGENT SITWELL
Sir?  I don’t understand-

STEVE
We’ve had word there might be an 
attempt to steal it.

Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight.

BROCK RUMLOW
Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap.  

AGENT SITWELL
(pulling out his phone)
I’ll have to check with the 
Director-

STEVE
No.  Trust me.  It’s okay...

Steve leans in, drawing them all close.  Then he whispers:

70


71

STEVE (CONT'D)
Hail Hydra.

THEIR EYES GO WIDE.

INT. STARK TOWER, 10TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

The elevator OPENS.  Steve steps out with THE SCEPTER.  
Sitwell and Rumlow stare after him, amazed.  

THE DOORS CLOSE.  STEVE SMILES TO HIMSELF.

INT. STARK TOWER, STAIRWELL - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners 
in the tiny stairwell.  He snorts, growing more pissed off.

A1 HULK
SO MANY STAIRS!

INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, 
followed by A1 THOR and LOKI.  

SWAT TROOPERS clear a path.  ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS 
MASK, REVEALING...OUR TONY.

TONY (INTO COM)
Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go.

MOVE IN CLOSE on A1 TONY to see...SCOTT, HIDING IN HIS HAIR.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Bombs away.

SCOTT DROPS BENEATH TONY’S BLACK SABBATH SHIRT.

INT. TONY STARK’S SHIRT - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)

SCOTT slides down Tony’s clavicle to the RT.  He sniffs.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Is that...Axe body spray?

TONY (OVER COM)
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for 
emergencies.  Can we focus, please?

71


72

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m going inside you...NOW.

SCOTT SQUEEZES BETWEEN A1 TONY’S SKIN AND THE RT. 

INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 TONY, A1 THOR, and LOKI approach the door.  ALEXANDER 
PIERCE intercepts them with a team of SHIELD AGENTS.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Mind if I ask where you’re going?

A1 THOR
We were thinking lunch, then 
Asgard.  And you are?

A1 TONY
Alexander Pierce.  He’s the guy 
behind the guys behind Fury, so 
don’t mess.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.
(to Thor)
I have to ask you to turn the 
prisoner over to me.

A1 THOR
Loki will answer to Odin, himself.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
No, he’ll answer to us.  “Odin” can 
have what’s left. 
(to Tony)
And we’ll need the case back, too.  
That’s been SHIELD property for 
over seventy years.  

A1 TONY
I’m not gonna argue who has 
authority here but jurisdictionally 
speaking, we are on Stark property. 
That is my name on the glass...

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Just give me the case.

Across the lobby, TONY OBSERVES FROM BEHIND HIS SWAT HELMET.  

72


73

TONY (INTO COM)
Move it, Stuart Little.  Things are 
getting dicey out here.

INTERCUT:

INT. TONY STARK’S RT - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

Scott studies A TANGLE OF COPPER WIRING.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
This place is a mess.
(finding a wire)
You promise you won’t die?

TONY (OVER COM)
You’re only giving me a minor 
cardiac dysrhythmia-

SCOTT LANG
That doesn’t actually sound minor-

Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY’S CASE.

TONY
Window’s closing.  Pull my plug.

SCOTT LANG
Here goes...

SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET.

IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Stark?

A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping.  THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE 
GROUND.  PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (CONT'D)
MEDIC!

A1 THOR
Stark?  Somebody get some help!  Is 
it your chest machine?

THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE.

In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE.  He 
SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD.  It SPINS across the floor... 

RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND.  Tony walks toward a side door.

73


74

TONY (INTO COM)
Meet me in the alley.  I’m just 
gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s- 

BUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, 
SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING. 

A1 HULK BASHES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LOBBY.

The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open.  THE 
TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott...

STOPPING AT LOKI’S FEET.  Loki stares at it in disbelief.  He 
glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid. 

THEN LOKI CALMLY REACHES DOWN WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS, GRASPS 
THE TESSERACT...AND TELEPORTS AWAY.  Scott stares, stunned.

SCOTT LANG
That wasn’t supposed to happen, was 
it?

A1 THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING...

A1 THOR
WHERE’S LOKI? 

SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT.

INT. STARK TOWER, 14TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

STEVE heads down a hall, SCEPTER IN HAND. 

SECURITY (OVER SPEAKER)
Building-wide alert, all units.  
Target Loki, maximum force.

STEVE (INTO COM)
Tony?  What’s going on?  Tell me 
you got that cube-

A1 STEVE (O.S.)
Strike Teams, clear Forty, then 
work down.

Before Steve can hide...A1 STEVE ROUNDS THE CORNER.

STEVE
Oh, great.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
Disregard.  I have eyes on Loki, 
Fourteenth Floor.

74


75

STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD.

STEVE
I’m not Loki.  And I don’t want to 
hurt you.

A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK.

A1 STEVE
You’re not going to get the chance-

A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE.  Steve stumbles.

STEVE
Forgot about that one.

They grapple.  Both their shields fall to the ground...

THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields 
back to their arms.  A1 Steve looks impressed.

A1 STEVE SWINGS.  STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM.  A1 Steve wipes 
the blood from his lip, squaring off.

A1 STEVE
I can do this all day-

STEVE
Yeah, I know...  

They battle on.  A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield 
aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS:

THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE.  A1 
Steve goes cold.  He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED.

A1 STEVE
Where’d you get this?

STEVE
PX.  Camp Lehigh.  1943.

A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing.

A1 STEVE
You’ve got a lot of nerve.

HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL.  Steve goes skidding.  He 
groans, looking up to see...HE’S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER.  

A1 STEVE moves in.  STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER 
to A1 Steve’s chest.  A1 STEVE’S EYES GO BLACK.  HE FREEZES.  

75


76

Steve stares, panting.  Finally, he picks up the compass from 
the floor, then considers A1 STEVE’S ASS.

STEVE
That is America’s ass.

EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

SMART HULK’S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a 
floppy sun hat covering his face.  

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I wish I could help you, Bruce...  

THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden.  She looks to ASTRAL 
BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
But if I were to give up the Time 
Stone to help your reality, I’d be 
dooming my own. 

ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not 
sure the science supports that.

ANCIENT ONE
And yet, you’re the one currently 
standing in the middle of my 
hydrangeas.

Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the 
middle of the hydrangeas.  He steps out of it.

ASTRAL BANNER
Lady, I just want to borrow your 
necklace- 

ANCIENT ONE
At what cost? 

SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, 
SPINNING IN UNISON.  A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
The Infinity Stones create the 
experience you know as the flow of 
time.  Remove one of the stones, 
and the flow splits.  

She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, 
BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.

76


(MORE)

77

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Now, your timeline might benefit.  
My new one...would definitely not.

SHE GESTURES.  OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL...

TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED 
STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM. 

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
In this new branch reality, without 
our chief weapon against the forces 
of darkness, our world would be 
overrun...

MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY.  HE OPENS HIS MOUTH...

BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM 
THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
For each stone you remove, you’ll 
create a new, vulnerable timeline.  
Millions will suffer.
(beat)
Now tell me, Doctor.  Can your 
science prevent all that?  

ASTRAL BANNER
No.  But it can erase it.

Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE.

ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D)
Because once we’re done with the 
stones, we can return each one to 
its own timeline.  At the moment it 
was taken.  So chronologically, in 
that reality, the stone never left.  

HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK.  THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS. 

ANCIENT ONE
You’re leaving out the most 
important part, though.  In order 
to put the stones back, you’d have 
to survive.

ASTRAL BANNER
We will.  I will.  I promise. 

ANCIENT ONE
I can’t risk this reality on a 
promise.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)

78

It is the duty of the Sorcerer 
Supreme to protect the Time Stone-

ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah?  Then why the hell did 
Strange give it away?

The Ancient One freezes.

ANCIENT ONE
What did you say?

ASTRAL BANNER
Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone.

ANCIENT ONE
Willingly?  Why?  

ASTRAL BANNER
Don’t know.  Maybe he made a 
mistake.

ANCIENT ONE
Or I did.

The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. 

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Strange is meant to be the best of 
us.

ASTRAL BANNER
Then he must have had a reason.

ANCIENT ONE
I fear you may be right...

Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH!  HE REINTEGRATES 
INTO THE SMART HULK BODY.  Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY.

SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM.

SMART HULK
Thank you.

ANCIENT ONE
I’m counting on you, Bruce. 
(re. the city behind her)
We all are.

THANOS.  He regards her for a moment.  Then...

THANOS
Run diagnostics.  Show me her 
memory file.

At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA’S INFORMATION.  
NEBULA’S BODY TWITCHES.

GAMORA WATCHES, TORN.  SOON...AN ALERT FLASHES.

EBONY MAW
Sir, the file appears...entangled.  
It was a memory, but not hers.
(dawning on him)
There’s another consciousness 
sharing her network.  Another 
Nebula.

THANOS
Impossible.

EBONY MAW
This duplicate carries a time 
stamp...from nine years in the 
future.

THANOS
Where is this “other Nebula?”

EBONY MAW
In our solar system.  On Morag.

THANOS
Can you access her?

EBONY MAW
Yes.  The two are linked.

THANOS PEERS INTO BAD NEBULA’S GLASSY EYES...

THANOS
Search the duplicate’s memory for 
Infinity Stones.

Maw works the console.  Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA’S 
BODY QUIVERS.  AFTER A BEAT, A BEAM SHOOTS OUT OF HER EYE...

PROJECTING AN IMAGE OF AVENGERS COMPOUND:

STEVE, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, 
CLINT, AND THOR GATHER IN THE LIVING AREA.

SMART HULK (HOLO)

TONY (HOLO)
Our history.  Not all of them are 
going to be a fun drop-in.

CLINT BARTON (HOLO)
Which means we’ve got to pick our

STEVE (HOLO)
Exactly.  Let’s start here-

THANOS
Freeze image.

THE IMAGE FREEZES.  THANOS STARES, RECOGNIZING THEM. 

GAMORA
Terrans?

THANOS
Avengers.  Unruly wretches.

He gestures to A BLURRY REFLECTION WITHIN THE HOLOGRAM.

THANOS (CONT'D)
What’s this reflection.  Amplify 
this, Maw.

EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA.

GAMORA
I don’t understand.  Two Nebulas?

Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces.

THANOS
No.  The same Nebula.  From two 
different times.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) 

Frigga walks down a corridor, alone.  THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN 
TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER.  She PAUSES, sensing something.  

Thor HIDES.  When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE.  Then he 
turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM.  Thor jumps.

FRIGGA
What are you doing?

THOR
Mother!  What?  Nothing.  Hello.

FRIGGA
You’re better off leaving the 
sneaking to your brother. 
(re. his bathrobe)
What are you wearing?

THOR
I always wear this.  It’s one of my 
favorites.

FRIGGA
And what’s wrong with your eye?

THOR
Oh, that.  You remember 
the...Battle of Harokin.  I took 
a...broadsword to the face?

He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom.  Frigga 
gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM.

FRIGGA
Oh.  You’re not the Thor I know at 
all, are you?

THOR
Yes, I am-

FRIGGA
I was raised by witches, boy.  I 
see with more than eyes, you know 
that.
(eyeing him)
I can see the future hasn’t been 
kind to you, has it?

THOR
I didn’t say I was from the 
future...

81


82

FRIGGA
Thor...

Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look.  Thor 
stares at his mom a long moment.  Then, he cracks:

THOR
I’m totally from the future.

FRIGGA
Yes, you are.

THOR
I need to talk to you. 

FRIGGA
We can talk. 

Frigga GRABS Thor by the cloak and yanks him away.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, JANE FOSTER’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)

CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MODERN BOOTS BENEATH AN ASGARDIAN GOWN.

TILT UP TO FIND...JANE FOSTER.  She studies the outfit.

Behind her, ROCKET RAISES THE EXTRACTION DEVICE OVER HIS 
HEAD, ABOUT TO JAB...

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)

FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers.

THOR
...and then it was done.  His head 
over there.  Body over there.  And 
me in the middle.  Just an idiot 
with an axe.

FRIGGA
You’re no idiot.  You’re here, 
aren’t you?  Seeking counsel from 
the smartest person in Asgard?

THOR
Yeah, I guess.

FRIGGA
An idiot, no.  A failure, 
absolutely.

82


83

THOR
That’s a little harsh-

FRIGGA
Quite a colossal one, by the sound 
of it.

THOR
Okay, maybe just stop talking.

FRIGGA
And you know what that makes you?  
Just like everyone else.

THOR
I’m not supposed to be like 
everyone else, though.

FRIGGA
Everyone fails at “who they’re 
supposed to be,” Thor.  The measure 
of a person, of a hero, is how well 
they succeed at being who they are.

Thor stares at her, biting back emotions.

THOR
I’ve really missed you, Mum.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)

ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND.  

ROCKET
I got it I got it I got it!

A TROOP OF EINHERJAR CHASE AFTER HIM.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)

THOR looks at THE OBSERVATORY: Dark Elves will soon attack.

THOR
Mum, I have to tell you something-

FRIGGA
No, son.  You don’t.  You’ve come 
to repair your future, not mine.   

THOR
But your future-

83


84

FRIGGA
Is none of my business.

Thor stares at her, torn.  THEN ROCKET RACES INTO THE ROOM.

ROCKET
(to Frigga)
Hi.  You must be Mom.  
(to Thor, re. the device)
I got the thing.  Come on, we gotta 
move-

Thor looks to Frigga.

THOR
I wish we had more time-

FRIGGA
This was a gift.  Now, go be the 
man you’re meant to be.  
(beat)
And eat a salad.

Thor smiles.  He and Rocket activate their time suits.

ROCKET
Three...two-

THOR
No.  Wait.

THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.  A long moment passes.

ROCKET
What am I looking at?

FRIGGA
Sometimes it takes a second.

Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND.  She grins, proud.

THOR
(relieved)
Still worthy.

Mother and son look at each other for the last time.  

THOR (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Mum.

FRIGGA
Goodbye, Son.

THEN, WHOOSH!  THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR.  

84


85

Suddenly...THE PALACE RUMBLES.  Frigga looks to the window, 
WHERE A DARK ELF WARSHIP DECLOAKS.  SHE REACHES FOR A SWORD.

PRELAP: “COME AND GET YOUR LOVE,” BY REDBONE.

EXT. MORAG, ABANDONED CITY - DAY (GUARDIANS)

PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, 
dances through the ruins of an alien city.

PULL BACK TO...NEBULA AND RHODEY WATCHING FROM BEHIND A ROCK.

RHODEY
So, he’s an idiot. 

NEBULA
Yes.

Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut.  When the horizon finally 
settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM.

QUILL
Oh, fu-

BAM!  RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE.  Quill drops, out cold. 

RHODEY
Sorry about that.  I know you guys 
were teammates and everything.

NEBULA
Do you hear me complaining?

Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack.  She pulls out AN 
ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK.

RHODEY
What is that?

NEBULA
The tool of a thief.  Come on.

They set out toward the RUINED CITY.  

INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)

WHIR, CLICK.  TWO HUGE, STONE DOORS SLIDE OPEN, REVEALING 
NEBULA AND RHODEY.  SHE STEPS IN.  RHODEY TRIES TO STOP HER.

85


86

RHODEY
Hang on.  This would be about the 
time the spikes come out, you know, 
with the skeletons still on them?

NEBULA
What are you talking about?

RHODEY
I’m just saying, when you break 
into a place called, “The Temple of 
the Power Stone”, there are 
usually... 

Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS 
PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Traps and stuff.
(Nebula steps inside)
Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
These are photovoltaic lasers on a 
constantly shifting matrix.  Gonna 
be damn near impossible to 
neutralize unless we-

SUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB.  
SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM.  

She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER 
BLACKENED CLAW.  

NEBULA
I wasn’t always like this.

He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her.  Favor his 
exoskeletal leg braces as he softens.

RHODEY
Yeah, me either.  I guess we do the 
best with what we’ve got, huh?  

SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Let’s get out of here.  Place gives 
me the creeps.  Sync up.  Three... 
two...one...

86


(MORE)

87

RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY.  Nebula goes for 
hers...BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK.  

SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL.  Her eyes 
snap open, projecting a hologram of...THANOS.

THANOS (HOLO)
What’s wrong?

INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

BACK IN THE INTERROGATION CELL, BAD NEBULA’S EYE BEAMS: IN 
THANOS’ LODGE, THE AVENGERS SURROUND A ONE-ARMED THANOS.

THANOS STUDIES HIS HOLO-FUTURE-SELF, WATCHING HIS DESTINY 
PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.

BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You murdered trillions.

THANOS (HOLO)
You should be grateful.

NATASHA (HOLO)
Where are the stones?

THANOS SMIRKS, PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER.

THANOS (HOLO)
Gone.  Reduced to atoms.  

BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You used them two days ago!

THANOS (HOLO)
I used the stones to destroy the 
stones.  The work is done.  It 
always will be...

HE STEPS FORWARD, FINISHING HIS OWN THOUGHT.

THANOS (HOLO) (CONT'D)
I AM INEVITABLE-
THANOS (CONT'D)
I AM INEVITABLE.

Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program.  THANOS WALKS 
THROUGH THE HOLOGRAM, STUDYING THE HEROES.

GAMORA
What did you do to them?

THANOS
Nothing.  Yet.
(piecing it together)
(MORE)

87


THANOS (CONT'D)

88

They’re not trying to stop 
something I’m going to do in our 
time.  They’re trying to undo 
something I’ve already done in 
theirs.

GAMORA
(uneasy)
The stones.  

THANOS
I found them all.  I won.  Tipped 
the cosmic scales to balance.

EBONY MAW
Sire.  This is your future?

THANOS
My destiny.  

He stares, mind whirling.  He nods.  THE MEMORY RESUMES.

RHODEY (HOLO)
He’s lying. 

NEBULA (O.S.)
My father is many things.  A liar 
is not one of them.

THANOS (HOLO)
Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve 
treated you too-

WHUMP.  THOR CUTS OFF THANOS’ HEAD.  THE VIEW LINGERS AS 
“NEBULA” STARES AT HER DEAD FATHER.  

THANOS STUDIES HIS SEVERED HEAD...AND SMILES.

THANOS (CONT'D)
And that is destiny fulfilled.

Gamora stares, torn.  But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos’ behalf.

EBONY MAW
Sire.  Your daughter is a traitor.

EBONY MAW GESTURES: CABLES WRAP AROUND NEBULA’S NECK.  SHE 
AWAKENS, PANICKED.  She looks up at Thanos.

BAD NEBULA
(choking)
No.  Please, father.  That’s not 
me.  I would never betray you.  
Please-

THANOS (CONT'D)

88


89

Thanos UNWRAPS the cord.  He touches his daughter’s face.

THANOS
Ssh, child.  I know.  And you’ll 
have the chance to prove it...

INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)

ZZZT.  ON THE FLOOR, NEBULA’S EYES SNAP OPEN, HORRIFIED.

NEBULA
He knows...

EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)

BOOTS POUND ACROSS THE ROCKS.  NEBULA RUNS FLAT OUT, 
DESPERATE, HEADING FOR THE ESCAPE POD. 

INT. ESCAPE POD - DAY (GUARDIANS)

NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK.

NEBULA (INTO COM)
Barton, Romanoff, come in.  We have 
a problem.  Thanos knows!  Thanos-

Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod.  Nebula looks out the 
cockpit window...

AS A TRACTOR BEAM PULLS THE ENTIRE POD SKYWARD.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - (AVENGERS 1)

IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building.  He hears A 
WHISTLE.  TONY waves from behind a crashed car.

TONY
We’ve got a problem.

TIME CUT:

STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT. 

STEVE
How could you lose it?

TONY
What do you want?  I got hit in the 
head with a Hulk!

89


90

SCOTT LANG
You said we only had one shot.  
This was our shot.  We shot it.  It 
was six stones or nothing!  Six 
stones-

TONY
You’re not helping-

SCOTT LANG
You ruined the Time Heist!  

TONY
Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, 
he’s comfortable there.  Knows the 
restaurants.  It’s a safe bet he 
visits home.  If we can just grab 
This-Thor and explain the 
situation, he and I can fly-

STEVE
Loki could be anywhere in the 
universe.  We’d be old men before 
we found him.

As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING...

STEVE (CONT'D)
What other options did we have on 
the Tesseract?  

SCOTT LANG
Whoa, whoa.  We don’t have any 
other options.  We can’t go to any 
other times.  No do-overs!  We’ve 
only got one particle left, each.  
Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we 
don’t come home.

STEVE
But if we don’t try, nobody else 
comes home, either.  

TONY
I got it!  There’s another way to 
re-take the Tesseract, and acquire 
new particles.  
(to Steve)
Military installation, Garden 
State.

Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.

90


91

STEVE
When were they both there?

TONY
I have a vaguely exact idea. 

STEVE
How vague?

SCOTT LANG
Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?  

TONY
I know they were there, and I know 
how I know.

STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT...

STEVE
Looks like we’re improvising.  

SCOTT LANG
Wait!  What are you improvising?

STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.

STEVE
Scott, take this back to the 
Compound.  

TONY
All right, suits on.  Try these 
coordinates. 04-07-19-70... 

SCOTT LANG
Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you 
do this and he’s wrong...you’re not 
coming back.

Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in.  He’s right.  
Even so, Tony turns to Steve.

TONY
You trust me?

STEVE
I do.

THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN...CLICK.  THEY BOTH HIT THEIR 
CUFFS.  TONY AND STEVE SHRINK TO NOTHING...

91


92

EXT. NEW JERSEY WOODS - DAY (1970)

CUE MUSIC: “HEY LAWDY MAMA,” STEPPENWOLF.

A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road.  The bumper 
sticker reads: “NUFF SAID.”

At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN 
SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side.

He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD.

STAN LEE
Make love, not war, baby!

He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: “U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - 
BIRTHPLACE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA.”  MOVE INTO THE BASE...

TONY (O.S.)
You weren’t actually born here, 
right?

EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)

SOLDIERS MARCH PAST AS...

Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE 
IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.

STEVE
The idea of me was.

TONY
(looking around)
All right.  If I was SHIELD and I 
wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic 
black site, where would I hide it?

STEVE
In plain sight.

Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, 
“MUNITIONS.”  He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD. 

TONY TOUCHES HIS GLASSES: HE X-RAYS INTO THE GROUND, 
ILLUMINATING...TWENTY FLOORS OF SECRET, UNDERGROUND BASE.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)

Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD 
AGENT.

92


93

She stares awkwardly at Tony.  Steve keeps his hat down.   
Ding.  The doors open.  Tony exits, then turns back to Steve.

TONY
Good luck with that mission, 
Captain.

STEVE
Good luck with your project, 
Doctor.

Tony ducks out.  The doors close.  The Agent turns to Steve.

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
You new here?

STEVE
Not exactly.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ARCHIVES - DAY (1970)

TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES.

TONY
Come on, you little hexahedron, 
where are you hiding?

Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE.  He grabs a briefcase, 
then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE’S LOCK.  

It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT.  Tony smiles.

TONY (CONT'D)
You may not know it now, but 
someday you’re going to be a real 
pain-in-the-ass.

Just then...THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS.

HOWARD STARK (O.S.)
Hey, Arnim, you in here?

TONY LOCKS THE CUBE IN THE BRIEFCASE JUST BEFORE...

HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF 
SAUERKRAUT.  TONY STARES, STUNNED.

HOWARD STARK (CONT'D)
Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola.  You 
seen him?

TONY
No.  Haven’t seen a soul.

93


94

Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed.  Howard 
looks at him, a bit suspicious. 

HOWARD STARK
I know you?  

From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH.   
  
He holds it out.

TONY
No, sir.  Just visiting from MIT.  

HOWARD STARK
That so?  Got a name?  

TONY
Howard...

HOWARD STARK
Easy to remember-

TONY
Potts.

HOWARD STARK
I’m Howard Stark.
(shaking hands)
You seem a little green around the 
gills, Potts.  Need some air? 

TONY
That’d be swell. 

Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase.  

HOWARD STARK
Need the briefcase? 

PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE...

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

CLOSE ON: AN ANT.  A phone continues to ring.  Then...

HANK PYM (O.S.)
Hello?

PULL BACK: THE ANT CRAWLS IN AN ANTFARM ON A LAB SHELF.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
Dr. Pym?

94


95

HANK PYM (O.S.)
That would be the number you 
called, yes.

PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
This is Captain Stevens, from 
shipping.  We have a package for 
you.

KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET.

HANK PYM (O.S.)
So bring it up.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
That’s the thing, sir, we can’t.

ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20’s), in brown hair and lab coat.

HANK PYM
Maybe I’m confused.  Isn’t that 
your job?

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
It’s just...sir, the box is 
glowing.  And to be honest, a 
couple of our mail guys aren’t 
feeling great-

HANK PYM
They didn’t open it, did they?!

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)

A DOOR MARKED, “DR. HENRY PYM,” flies open.  Hank exits, 
fuming, brushing past...STEVE.

Steve watches Hank stalk off...THEN DUCKS INTO HANK’S LAB.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)

HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR.  The doors shut.

TONY
Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big 
night planned? 

95


96

HOWARD STARK
(lifting one at a time)
My wife’s expecting.  And too much 
time at the office.

Tony puzzles the dates out in his head...

TONY
Congratulations.

HOWARD STARK
Thanks.

TONY
How far along is she?

HOWARD STARK
Gee, I suppose...
(indicating)
...this far.  She’s at the point 
where she can’t stand the sound of 
my chewing.  So I guess I’ll be 
eating in the pantry again.

TONY
I have a little girl.

TONY SMILES.  He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s 
granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born.

HOWARD STARK
A girl would be nice.  Less chance 
she’d turn out exactly like me. 

TONY
Would that be so bad?

HOWARD STARK
Let’s just say the greater good 
hasn’t always outweighed my own  
self interest.  

The elevator doors open.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

STEVE searches Hank’s lab, finally opening the fridge to 
find...A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES.

96


97

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)

Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator.  But it 
opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P.  

M.P.
You’ve never seen either of these 
men before?

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
No.  But I have an eye for this. 
Something looked fishy.

M.P.
Describe ‘fishy’.

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
One of them had a hippie beard.

M.P.
We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

M.P.
(over walkie-talkie)
This is Chesler.  We need every 
available agent to sub-level 6.  We 
have a potential breach.

Steve ducks through the nearest door...

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970)

Steve enters a darkened office.  A glass wall separates it 
from another bullpen.

Then he sees something on the desk.  He stares, stunned, at 
two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. 

THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE.

Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.”

Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never 
forgot about him.  

Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN.  LIGHTS SNAP ON, 
revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall.

PEGGY CARTER
So, send them in.

97


98

MALE AGENT
They’re trying, ma’am, but 
Braddock’s unit has been stopped by 
lightning strikes.

PEGGY CARTER
Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the 
weather projections.  You call 
Braddock and tell him to shelter in 
place.  Assuming he’s bright enough 
to come out of the rain. 

MALE AGENT (O.S.)
Yes, ma’am. 

Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED.

Peggy rifles through a file cabinet.

PEGGY CARTER
Here we are...

She flips through a file, reading.  In the darkness behind 
her, Steve approaches.  Peggy reads something disturbing.

PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D)
Crikey O’Reilly.
(calling out)
Sergeant?  Hang up and call Air 
Command.  Braddock needs back up, 
immediately.

MALE AGENT
Ma’am?

PEGGY CARTER
Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s 
looking at...

She slaps the file closed and hurries out.  

Steve stares after her a long moment.

EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)

Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. 

TONY
Got any names, yet?

HOWARD STARK
If it’s a boy, my wife likes 
Elmonzo. 

98


99

TONY
You might let that stew a while. 
You’ve got time. 

HOWARD STARK
What are you, couple years older 
than me?

TONY
Yeah.  I guess.

HOWARD STARK
Let me ask you a question.  When 
your kid was born...were you 
nervous?  

TONY
Wildly.

HOWARD STARK
Did you feel qualified?  Like you 
had any idea how to successfully 
operate that thing?

TONY
I pieced it together as I went 
along.  I thought about what my dad 
did...

HOWARD STARK
My old man never met a problem he 
couldn’t solve with a belt.

TONY
I tried to hold onto the good 
stuff.  Dad dropped the odd pearl, 
here and there.

HOWARD STARK
Like what?

TONY
“No amount of money ever bought a 
second of time.”  

HOWARD STARK
That’s good.  Smart guy.

TONY
He did his best.

99


100

HOWARD STARK
I tell you, this kid’s not even 
here yet, but there’s nothing I 
wouldn’t do for him.

Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED.  Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) 
opens the limo door.

HOWARD STARK (CONT'D)
Besides, if I fall down on the 
fathering job, old Jarvis is ready 
to pick up the slack.  Isn’t that 
right?

EDWIN JARVIS
Indeed, sir.  I shall endeavor to 
teach the lad the rudiments of 
judo.

Tony smiles at his old friend.  As Jarvis gets in the car, 
Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP.  TIME TO GO. 

Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand.

HOWARD STARK
Well, good to meet you, Potts.

TONY
You’re going to do fine, Howard.

HOWARD STARK
Thanks.  See you around?

TONY
Count on it...

As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis.

HOWARD STARK
Have we met him before?

EDWIN JARVIS
We’ve met a lot of people, sir.

HOWARD STARK
Seems very familiar.  
(beat)
Weird beard.

EXT. SANCTUARY 2 - SPACE

The Sanctuary-2 cruises ominously through space.

101

INT. SANCTUARY-2, PRISON CELL - DAY

WHACK!  NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.  She gets to 
her knees, looking up at...BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER. 

BAD NEBULA
You’re weak.

NEBULA
I’m you-

BAD NEBULA
Shut up!

BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN.  GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS 
BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS.

THEN GAMORA ENTERS.  Nebula softens, taking in her (once 
dead) sister.

NEBULA
You could stop this.  You know you 
want to.  
(off Gamora’s look)
Did you see what happens in the 
future?  Thanos finds the Soul 
Stone.

MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING...  

NEBULA (CONT'D)
You want to know how he does that?  
You want to know what he does to 
you-

BAD NEBULA
ENOUGH!

BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A 
JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.  

BAD NEBULA (CONT'D)
You disgust me...but that doesn’t 
mean you’re useless.

SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA’S HEAD. 

Gamora takes in this new development...

INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY

Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne.  She hands 
him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS.  He smiles.

101


102

Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head.

BAD NEBULA
How do I look?

EXT. BENATAR - SPACE

THE BENATAR approaches Vormir.

TITLE: VORMIR, 2014

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 

NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE 
MAJESTIC, PURPLE PLANET.

CLINT BARTON
Under different circumstances, this 
would be totally awesome.

EXT. VORMIR - DAY

Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune.  
Clint fires a Pym Particle.

WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS.  CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN 
BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket.  

CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR, 
TOWARD...THE MOUNTAIN.

EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

Natasha and Clint climb, ragged.  They approach AN ARCHWAY.  

CLINT BARTON
Really starting to regret my choice 
here.

NATASHA
Yeah.  I’m gonna bet the raccoon 
didn’t have to climb a mountain.  

CLINT BARTON
I don’t think technically he’s a 
raccoon...

NATASHA
Whatever.  He eats garbage-

102


103

THEY HEAR SOMETHING.  THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP.  A HOODED 
FIGURE APPROACHES.   

HOODED FIGURE 
I assure you, you have nothing to 
fear from me.

CLINT BARTON
Creepy.

HOODED FIGURE
Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan.  
Clint, son of Edith.  

CLINT BARTON
Creepier.

NATASHA
Who are you?

RED SKULL
Consider me a guide.  To you, and 
to all who seek the Soul Stone. 

NATASHA
Great.  You show us where it is, 
and we’ll be on our way.

The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL. 

RED SKULL
Oh, liebchen.  If only it were that 
easy...

EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY   

START ON JAGGED ROCKS.  TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and 
CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.

RED SKULL
What you seek lies in front of you.  
As does what you fear.

NATASHA
The Stone is down there?

RED SKULL
For one of you.  For the other...
(smiling it away)
The Stone demands a sacrifice.  In 
order to take it, you must leave 
behind that which you love.

103


104

SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL.

RED SKULL (CONT'D)
A soul for a soul.  

Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned.

TIME CUT:

RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind.  

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
Maybe he’s full of shit.  

FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE.

NATASHA
I don’t think so.

CLINT BARTON
Why, because he knew your daddy’s 
name?

NATASHA
I didn’t.
(off his look)
Thanos left here with the stone,  
and without his daughter.  You 
really think that’s a coincidence?

They both look out at the well, heavy. 

NATASHA (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Whatever it takes...

CLINT BARTON
(under his breath)
Whatever it takes...

Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.

NATASHA
If we don’t get the stone, billions 
of people are going to stay dead.

CLINT BARTON
Then I guess we both know who it 
has to be.

NATASHA
Yeah.  Guess we do.

They take each other’s hand.  A long goodbye beat.  Except...

104


105

CLINT BARTON
I’m starting to think we don’t mean 
the same person.

NATASHA
For the last five years, I’ve been 
trying to do one thing -- get to 
right here.  This is all it’s been 
about.  Bringing everybody back. 

CLINT BARTON
Do not get all decent on me- 

NATASHA
You think I want to do it?  I’m 
trying to save your life, you idiot-

CLINT BARTON
And I don’t want you to.
(beat)
Nat.  You know what I’ve done.  
What I am now.  Your life’s worth 
ten of mine-

NATASHA
I don’t judge people by their worst 
mistakes-

CLINT BARTON
Maybe you should-

NATASHA
You didn’t.

That stops him.  He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in.  

CLINT BARTON
You’re a pain in my ass, you know 
that?

She relaxes for the briefest moment.  Just then, CLINT SWEEPS 
OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Tell my family I love them.

SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.

NATASHA
Tell them yourself.

SHE FIRES A WIDOW’S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR 
THE CLIFF.  SHE’S HALFWAY THERE WHEN...

BOOM!  AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET.  

Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff.  Just 
as he falls...

NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR.  They drop, but NATASHA 
SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF.

THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE.  She attaches the other end of 
her grappling line to Clint’s belt...saving his life.  

She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers.

CLINT BARTON
Damn you.

They hang there a long, terrible moment.  CLINT’S GRASP 
STARTS TO LOOSEN.  Finally, she looks him in the eye.

NATASHA
Let me go.

CLINT BARTON
No.  Please no...

The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.

NATASHA
It’s okay...

CLINT BARTON
Natasha, no-

Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out 
of Clint’s grasp.

She falls...  

Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, 
helpless, stifling his scream.  

WHOOSH!  THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.

EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE.  The 
camera rotates until we see...IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY.

CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN.  He sits 
up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE.  His eyes well.  

106


107

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS... WHOOSH, CLINT 
GROWS INTO THE PRESENT ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS:

SMART HULK HOLDS THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, SCOTT HAS THE SCEPTER, 
RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY 
& STEVE THE TESSERACT.  NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT.

Everyone looks around, exhausted.  Amazed.

RHODEY
Are you telling me that actually 
worked?

SMART HULK
Did we get them all?

CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES.  Steve turns, concerned.

STEVE
Clint?  Are you okay?

Clint stares, haunted.  SMART HULK realizes...

SMART HULK 
Where’s Nat?  
(everyone stares)
WHERE’S NAT?!

Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy.  

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN

SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock.  
Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING.

TONY
Do we know if she had family?

STEVE
Yeah.  Us.

Thor turns, thrown.

THOR
Why are you doing that?

TONY
I’m just asking a question-

107


108

THOR
Why are we talking as if she’s 
dead?  We have the stones.  Bring 
her back.  C’mon, stop this shit.

Clint squeezes away tears.

CLINT BARTON
We can’t get her back.  

THOR
What’s he talking about?  Of 
course, we can.  

CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone.  That’s why. 

THOR
No offense, but you’re...a very 
earthly being.  We’re talking about 
space magic, here.  “Can’t” seems a 
little definitive, don’t you think?

CLINT BARTON
Well, I know I’m a little outside 
my pay grade here, but, she still 
isn’t here, is she? 

THOR
That’s my point-

CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone.  At least 
that’s what the red, floating guy 
said.  But why don’t you go talk to 
him, okay?  Why don’t you grab your 
hammer and fly to that place and 
talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. 
(beat)
It was supposed to be me.  She 
sacrificed her life for that 
goddamn stone.  She bet her life on 
it.

That lands heavily on all of them.  A moment passes.

THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER.  It skips 
across the surface like a stone.  

SMART HULK
She’s not coming back.  We have to 
make it worth it.  We have to.

108


109

STEVE
We will.

PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass.  SOON, 
ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE.  

TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch.

The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN 
GAUNTLET.  NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE.

Smart Hulk releases a deep breath.

TIME CUT:

THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES 
EMBEDDED IN THE BACK.  Pull back to find...

SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND 
ROCKET FINE TUNE THE GLOVE.

ROCKET
All right.  The glove’s ready.  
Question is, who’s gonna snap their 
freaking fingers?

Everyone stares a beat.  Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET.

THOR
I’ll do it.  

TONY
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-

STEVE
Thor, we haven’t decided who’s 
putting that on.

THOR
Oh.  Were all of you just waiting 
for the right opportunity?

ROCKET
Maybe I was getting around to it-

SCOTT LANG
We should at least discuss it-

109


110

THOR
Staring at the thing isn’t going to 
bring everybody back, is it?  Look, 
I’m the strongest Avenger.  It’s my 
responsibility.  Fate wills it so.

TONY
Hold on, hold on-  

THOR
Stop it!  Let me do this.  Let me 
do something good.  Something right-

TONY
That thing is channeling enough 
energy to light up a continent. 
You’re in no condition-

THOR
What do you think is coursing 
through my veins right now?

RHODEY
Cheez Whiz?

THOR
Lightning.

Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet.

SMART HULK
Lightning won’t help you, pal.  
It’s gotta be me.
(approaching)
You saw what those stones did to 
Thanos.  They almost killed him.  
None of you could survive.

STEVE
And how do we know you can?

SMART HULK
We don’t.  But the radiation’s 
mostly gamma.  
(beat)
It’s like I was made for this...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS.  Then, clack, the lights 
come on, revealing...

NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE.

110

111

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET.  The moment of truth.

TONY
Good to go?

SMART HULK
Let’s do it.

TONY
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos 
snapped away five years ago, you’re 
just bringing them back...to today.  
Don’t change anything from the last 
five years.  Got it?  

SMART HULK
Got it.  

PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves:  

STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm.  SCOTT deploys his 
helmet.  RHODEY readies his repulsors. 

ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR.  TONY 
armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him. 

TONY
Friday, why don’t you go ahead and 
activate Barn Door Protocol?

STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP.

FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET.

SMART HULK
(under his breath)
Everybody’s coming home...  

HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE.  SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, 
TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1.  HE STRUGGLES.  

THOR
What’s happening?  Take it off, 
take if off!

STEVE
Bruce, you okay?  

TONY
Talk to me, Banner. 

111


112

SMART HULK
I’m...okay... 

THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS.

CRAAAACK!  THE STONES FLARE.  A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES 
UP SMART HULK’S ARM.  HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN.

A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.  

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE.  She takes off her glove, 
revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM.  THIS IS BAD NEBULA.

SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS 
INTO THE CONSOLE.  THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. 

AS SHE HURRIES AWAY...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT 
FROM THE HANGAR.  AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

WHOOSH!  EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW.  THE GAUNTLET FALLS 
OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.

SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. 
EVERYONE RUSHES OVER.  Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse.

STEVE
Bruce!

TONY
Don’t move him! 

Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING.  
SCOTT walks toward the courtyard.

Smart Hulk’s eyes clear.  He grasps Steve’s arm.

SMART HULK
Did it work?

They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them.  

JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES.  

112


113

A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE.  On the home 
screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.”

CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. 

CLINT BARTON
Honey?

AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER.  DOZENS OF 
CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED.

SCOTT LANG
Guys, I think it-

BOOM!  THE BUILDING EXPLODES.  DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY

A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Nothing moves.  The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT 
CRATER A MILE WIDE.  Avengers Compound has been destroyed.  

Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the 
clouds.  It hovers over the ruins like a vulture.

AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing...

THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS.  The Mad Titan looks 
around at the devastation he has wrought.  

THANOS (INTO COM)
Daughter?  

BAD NEBULA (OVER COM)
Yes, father...

OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA.  Bruised and dirty. 

THANOS
So this is the future.  Well done.  

She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE.

BAD NEBULA
Thank you, Father.  They suspected 
nothing. 

THANOS
The arrogant never do.

113


114

Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Go.  Find the stones.  Bring them 
to me.

BAD NEBULA
What will you do?

THANOS
Wait.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED.

SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE 
GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS.  BELOW... 

RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING. 

RHODEY
Canopy!  Canopy!

Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN.  HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to 
see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE.  AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM...  

THE CEILING RUMBLES.  SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING. 

RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)
Mayday!  Tony.  Cap.  Does anybody 
hear me?!

HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET.  Rocket wheezes, in pain.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Hang on!

RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS.  HE HEAVES, 
finally managing to lever it off of Rocket.  THEN... 

THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY.  A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER 
WATER RUSH IN.  RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.  

RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)
Mayday!  Mayday!  We are taking on 
water!

INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY

CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.

114


115

RHODEY (OVER COM)
...anyone...Mayday...Mayday-

Scott groans, coming to.

SCOTT LANG
Wait, what...?

REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE 
IRON PATRIOT HELMET. 

ROCKET (OVER COM)
Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses up-

RHODEY (OVER COM)
...trapped...drowning...no time...

Scott jumps to his feet.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
No!  Wait, I’m here!

Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR.

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY

WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS 
TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN.  He groans.  

He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON 
THE SCREEN.  “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.”  Clint stares, amazed.  

He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET.  It’s 
bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM.

CLINT BARTON (INTO COM)
Cap?  Stark?  Anyone?

STATIC.  Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT.  

He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow.  
HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... 

DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING.  
CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS.  THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE.

INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY

FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING.  MOVE THROUGH 
SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold.  SOMEONE SHAKES HIM.  

He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD.

115


116

TONY
You lose this again, I’m keeping 
it.

STEVE
What happened?

TONY
Told you.  We messed with time.  
Time messed back.

Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab.

STEVE
Where are the others?

TONY
I read life signs, maybe 800 feet 
down, but it’s hard to tell.  

They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN 
AT...THANOS.  Sitting on a rock.  Waiting.

TONY (CONT'D)
What’s he been doing?

THOR
Absolutely nothing.   

The three of them stare a long moment.  Then, as if sensing 
them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY.

STEVE
Son of a bitch.

TONY
Yeah.

STEVE
Where are the stones?

TONY
Somewhere under all of this.  All I 
know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.

STEVE
So we keep it that way.

That lands.  This is their chance.

THOR
You know it’s a trap.

TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.

116


(MORE)

117

TONY
Don’t think I care.

THOR
Just so we’re all in agreement.

Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT.  He holds out 
his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM.

CRACK!  LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR.

THOR (CONT'D)
Let’s kill him properly this time.

STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative.

THANOS
You could not live with your own 
failure.  And where did that bring 
you?  Right back to me.  

TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG.  
STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE.

THANOS (CONT'D)
I thought by eliminating half of 
life, the other half would thrive.  
But you’ve shown me that’s 
impossible.
(beat)
Life clings to the past with bloody 
fingernails.  As long as there are 
those who remember what was, there 
will be those unable to accept what 
can be.  They will resist.

TONY
Yep.  We’re all kinds of stubborn.

THANOS
I’m thankful.  Because now I know 
what I must do.

Thanos reaches for his helmet.

THANOS (CONT'D)
I will shred this universe down to 
its last atom.  
(MORE)

117


THANOS (CONT'D)

118

And then, with the stones you’ve 
collected for me, create a new one, 
teeming with life that knows not 
what it has lost, but only what it 
has been given.  A grateful 
universe.

STEVE
Born out of blood.

Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time.

THANOS
They’ll never know it.

THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Because you won’t be alive to tell 
them.

Tony glances over at Steve.  Ready?  Steve nods...

JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS.  WHAM!  ALL THREE AVENGERS 
ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT.

THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS.  THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, 
RELENTLESS. 

PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2...

INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL.  After a beat...THE 
DOORS RATCHET OPEN.  She stares into the shadows.

NEBULA
What do you want?

GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL.  THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT 
ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER.

GAMORA
In the future...what happens to you 
and me?

NEBULA
I try to kill you.  Several times.  
But, eventually...we become 
friends.  We become sisters.

GAMORA
That’s hard to believe.

THANOS (CONT'D)

118


119

NEBULA
A lot of things that happen will be 
hard to believe. 

Gamora nearly smiles.  She takes a long look at Nebula.  
Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND.  

GAMORA
Come on.  We can still stop him.

Nebula takes a deciding moment.  Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S 
HAND.  One sister pulls the other to her feet.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING.  RHODEY HANGS ONTO A 
PIPE AS THE WATER RISES.

SMART HULK
Rhodey.  Rocket.  Get out of here. 
Save yourselves.

ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING.

ROCKET
No good.  Couldn’t even...find a 
hole...small enough to abandon you 
through.

Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A 
FOOT.  His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight.  

Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS.  

SMART HULK
AAARRRGH!

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS

THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT. 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY

A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS.  AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT 
LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP.  

RHODEY (OVER COM)
MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
HANG ON!  I’M COMING!

119


120

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY

SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS.  CLINT 
AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS.  

Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a 
button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES...

BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS.

Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT.

A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him.

Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT 
SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides.

Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as...

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER.  He gasps, safe.  Then he 
looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM.

CLINT BARTON
Oh, hey.  I know you.

She gently takes the Gauntlet.

BAD NEBULA (INTO COM)
Father.  I have the stones.

CLINT BARTON
What-

Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest 
and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD...

GAMORA (O.S.)
Stop.

COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED.

BAD NEBULA
You’re betraying us?

GAMORA
Not you.

GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating.  
Bad Nebula stares at her future self.

120


121

NEBULA
You don’t have to do this.  

BAD NEBULA
I am this.

GAMORA
No.  You’re not.

Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward.  She taps her head.

NEBULA
You’ve seen what we become-

GAMORA
Sister, listen to her-

BAD NEBULA
Shut up.  You’re a traitor!

NEBULA
You can change.

Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace.

BAD NEBULA
He won’t let me.

BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN 
AND SHOOTS HER DOWN.  BAD NEBULA DROPS.

Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. 

Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused.

CLINT BARTON
I’m not even gonna ask.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS...

THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE 
BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT.

TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS 
PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST.

THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS...

THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE  AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD 
AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER.  WHACK! 

121


122

MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT.  TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD.

TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Boss?  Wake up!

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE 
CEILING, FACING THE END.  RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK.

RHODEY
See you on the other side, man.

They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Steve slashes at Thanos.  The Titan brutally bats him aside.  

Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris.  
THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER.

Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it.  He 
presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home.

Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR.

THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES 
IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND.

Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man 
worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS.  

Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR.  

THOR
I...knew...it...

STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW.  THANOS TUMBLES.

BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING 
AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY.

Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS 
ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS.

THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE.  

HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE.  
BLOW AFTER BLOW.  IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP.  

122


123

THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE 
ACROSS THE FIELD. 

Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm.

THANOS 
In all my years of conquest...

Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Of violence and slaughter...it was 
never personal.

Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES.  

THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK 
ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS.  

THANOS (CONT'D)
But I’ll tell you now, the things 
I’m about to do to your stubborn, 
annoying, little planet...

Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE.  

THANOS (CONT'D)
I’m going to enjoy it.  Very, very 
much.

Steve stares at Thanos and his army.  And even in the face of 
such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet.

THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken 
shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM.

One man against thousands.  All alone.

But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES.  He strains to hear.  
The com crackles again.  We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE.

MUFFLED VOICE (ON COM)
-ap-...-comin-...-ot-

Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it.  Slowly, SOUND 
RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR:

SAM WILSON (O.S.)
Cap.  On your left.

PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE.  OUT OF 
IT FLIES...SAM WILSON.

123


124

Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN 
MORE PORTALS OPEN.

FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER 
PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS.

FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, 
GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY.

FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY.

FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, 
AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS.

THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand 
as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry.

Wong and Strange quickly find each other.

DR. STRANGE
Is that everyone?

WONG
You wanted more?!

JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS 
AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW.

SCOTT LANG
Top floor, everybody out!

HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND 
RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR.  

STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS.

PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND.

STEVE
Avengers...assemble.

THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES!  EVERYONE FOLLOWS 
SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD.  

ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE.

TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH!  

GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW.  

DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life 
out of KORG.

124


125

TONY blasts overhead.  RESCUE joins him.  Together, they 
strafe the field.  

STEVE and THOR fight together.  Both hold out their hands.  
Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns.

THOR
No.  You take the little one.

Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS.  One knocks him into 
an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when...

THWIP.  PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the 
path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT.  SQUISH.

Tony stares at Peter, emotional.  They retract their helmets.

PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark.  Holy cow, you would not 
believe what’s been going on.  Do 
you remember when we were in space?  
And I got all dusty?  I must’ve 
passed out, because I woke up and 
you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange 
was, and he was like, “it’s been 
five years, they need us.”  And he 
started doing that yellow sparkly 
thing he does-

But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s 
face into his chest plate.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
(muffled)
Oh.  This is nice. 

ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran 
soldiers.  One leaps off an outcropping...

TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER 
SAKAARAN WAITS.

Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike.  
THEN BLAM!  The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill.

He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL 
SMOKING.  Quill stares, amazed.

QUILL
Gamora?

HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL. 

125


126

QUILL (CONT'D)
I thought I lost you.

He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts.  
Twice.  He goes down, gasping.

QUILL (CONT'D)
You missed the first time...then 
you got ‘em both the second time.

She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER.

GAMORA
This is the one?  Seriously?  

NEBULA
Your choices were him or a tree.

ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A 
CHITAURI APE.  Just before the ape tramples Clint...

SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN.

Clint runs on.  The heroes confer over coms.

CLINT BARTON
What do you want to do with this 
thing? 

STEVE
Get those stones as far away as 
possible!

SMART HULK
No!  We need to send them back 
where they came from.

TONY
There’s no way to send them back.   
Thanos destroyed our time machine.

SCOTT LANG
Hold on! 
(shrinking to normal size)
That wasn’t our only time machine. 

He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN.  From a distance, we hear, 
“LA CUCARACHA.”  Steve immediately gets it.

STEVE
Does anyone see an ugly, brown van 
out there?

ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.

126


127

VALKYRIE 
Yeah.  But you’re not going to like 
where it’s parked.

LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND 
ENEMY LINES.

STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE 
VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES. 

TONY (INTO COM)
Scott, how long do you need to get 
that thing working?

SCOTT LANG
Uh, maybe ten minutes.

STEVE
Get it started.  We’ll get the 
stones to you.

HOPE VAN DYNE
We’re on it, Cap.

SCOTT glances at her.  Cap?  THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY.

TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING.

TONY
Doc.  You said we win one in 14 
million.  Is this how it goes down?

DR. STRANGE
If I tell you what happens, it 
won’t happen.

TONY
You better be right. 

Tony rockets away.  Strange coolly watches him go.

ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS.

EBONY MAW
Sire, the stones! 

THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, 
CARRYING THE GAUNTLET.

A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL.

T’CHALLA
Clint, give it to me. 

127


128

CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS.

ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF 
CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN.

INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS

They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat.  Out the 
windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS.

SCOTT LANG
(digging around)
Ignition’s broken.  I’ll hotwire it-

HOPE VAN DYNE
Wait, you know how to do that?

Scott splices wires.  Sparks fly.

SCOTT LANG
I was in prison.  I know how to do 
a lot of things.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM 
OFF HIS FEET.  THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING.

AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS 
TO FLOAT.  THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE...

WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM.

WANDA
You took everything from me.

Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back.

THANOS
I don’t even know who you are.

WANDA
You will.

WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT 
HIM.  AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT...

T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET.  SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW 
MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM.  

T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.

128


129

PETER PARKER (O.S.)
I GOT IT!  

T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST.  HE HURLS THE 
GAUNTLET...THWIP!  Peter snatches it out of the air.

HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
Activate instant kill!

His robotic arms slash with expert precision.

ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS 
ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND.  

Thanos groans, outmatched.

THANOS (INTO COM)
Rain fire.  Wipe them all out.

CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT. 

CORVUS GLAIVE
But, sire, our troops-

THANOS (INTO COM)
Just do it!

HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP.

BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as...

THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS.  SAKAARANS 
AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT.

THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK.  CRACKS FORM.

PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN.

PEPPER POTTS (INTO COM)
Um, is anyone else seeing this?

TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS 
THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE.  SUDDENLY... 

STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP 
THE BANK.  MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.”  

THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE.

ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being 
overwhelmed by Outriders.

129


130

PETER PARKER
I got this...I got this...I don’t 
got this.

STEVE
Hey, Queens!  Heads up!

STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG.  PETER WEBS ON...LETTING 
THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER.  

A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS 
RESCUES HIM.

PEPPER POTTS
Hang on, kid.  I’ve got you.

She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE 
FLYING PAST.  PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS.

PETER PARKER
Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!

VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT 
FAST ENOUGH.  A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND.  

HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET.  

ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR 
HEROES.  ALL HOPE IS LOST.

Rocket and Groot dive for cover.  Groot wraps his branches 
around them both.

ROCKET
At least we’re going out together 
this time...

SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT.  ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM 
COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS.

SAM WILSON flies overhead.

SAM WILSON
What the hell is this?

TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD.

TONY
Friday, what are they firing at?

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Something just entered the upper 
atmosphere.

130


131

Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH.

GROOT
(nervous)
I am Groot.

Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming.

ROCKET
Just wait for it.

SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP.  

BOOM!  THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE 
OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah! 

CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN 
THROUGH THE HULL.  BOOM!  THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING.  

CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING. 

STEVE (OVER COM)
Danvers!  We’re gonna need an 
assist down here!

CAROL DANVERS (INTO COM)
(under ragged breath)
Roger...Rogers...

INT. VAN - DAY

Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m almost there.  Where’s the 
glove?

EXT. CRATER - DAY

CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS 
THE GAUNTLET TIGHT.  HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED.

PETER PARKER
Uh, hey.  I’m Peter Parker.

CAROL DANVERS
Hey, Peter Parker.  You got 
something for me?

131


132

Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde.

PETER PARKER
I don’t know how you’re gonna get 
it through all that-

WANDA (O.S.)
Don’t worry, kid...

Peter turns to see...

WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI 
WAITING.  Wanda’s hands begin to glow.

OKOYE
She’s got help.

Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet 
under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT.

AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING 
THROUGH HIS TROOPS.  HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN.

SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL.

SCOTT LANG
Thirty seconds!

Thanos understands immediately.  HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR 
FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING...

ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI 
BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY.

CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT.

CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING 
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO...

THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE.

ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW 
JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. 

SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH.  BUT JUST 
AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS...

THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR...

BOOM!  THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, 
TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER.

THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR.

132


133

TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, 
LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT.

The problem is...SO DOES THANOS.

TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES.  THEY 
COLLIDE.  THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN.  

THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, 
POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE.  

STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM.  FINALLY CLEAR, 
THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET.  BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP...

CAROL ARRIVES.  SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM 
CLOSING HIS FIST.  HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE.

CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS...

THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES 
CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING.

THE FIELD GOES QUIET.  NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY.

Tony gets to his knees, realizing...

The Avengers are going to lose.  

ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER.  

STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE.  He 
looks to Tony...

Tony meets his eye.  And in that moment, all Strange can do 
is hold up a single finger.  “One.”

ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE 
GAUNTLET.  JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM...

TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING 
IT IN A VISE.  THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE.

HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT.

THANOS
I am...inevitable. 

THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS.  But nothing happens.  Confused, 
Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. 

He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, 
FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST:

133


134

COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES.  POWER SURGES THROUGH 
TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND...

TONY
And I...am Iron Man.

SNAP!

WHOOSH.  THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST.

ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON 
THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING.  

THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR.  SHIPS 
VANISH FROM THE SKY.  CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY...

LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE.  AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS 
DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE.  He watches as...

HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE.  FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS.

ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE.

QUILL
Babe?  Gamora?

ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED 
ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED.  

Dying.

RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO 
LATE.  TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO.  Then...

PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand.

PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s 
okay...Mr. Stark, we won.  You did 
it, sir...

But Tony gazes past him.  Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s 
shoulder, guiding him away...

AS PEPPER ARRIVES.  She kneels, heartsick.

PEPPER POTTS
Hey, Friday, what’ve we got?

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Life functions critical.

Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows.

134


(MORE)

135

PEPPER POTTS
Tony, look at me.  We’re going to 
be okay... 

He stares at her, tears welling.  I’m sorry.

She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him.

PEPPER POTTS (CONT'D)
You can rest now.

When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy.  

Everything goes quiet.  All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the 
full weight of what’s happened dawning on them.  

Tony Stark is gone.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students.  He 
searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS.  

As they embrace...

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco.

TONY (O.S.)
Everybody wants a happy ending.  
But it doesn’t always roll that 
way.  Maybe this time.  

On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of 
them grinning.

EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY

TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE.  Then 
the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out.

TONY (O.S.)
I’m hoping if you play this back, 
it’s in celebration.  
(MORE)

135


TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(MORE)

136

I hope families are reunited, I 
hope we get it back and something 
like a normal version of the planet 
has been restored.  If there ever 
was such a thing.

She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky.

EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET

ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, 
RAMONDA.  Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset.

TONY (O.S.)
God, what a world.  Universe, now. 
If you’d told me ten years ago that 
we weren’t alone, let alone to this 
extent, I probably wouldn’t have 
been surprised.  But come on...

EXT BARTON HOME - DAY

The Quinjet touches down.  The rear jump door opens, 
revealing CLINT.  He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed.

TONY (O.S.)
Who knew what epic forces of dark 
and light would come into play?  
For better or worse, that’s the 
reality our children get to grow up 
in.

They throw themselves into his arms.  He kisses their heads, 
tears in his eyes.  Finally, he looks up to see...

LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD 
NATHANIEL’S HAND.  Clint gathers them all into a hug.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY

A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on 
the table.

TONY (O.S.)
That’s why I thought I’d probably 
better record a little greeting, in 
the case of…an untimely death on my 
part.  

TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(MORE)

136


TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

137

I mean, death at any time is 
untimely, but...this “time travel” 
thing we’re going to try to pull 
off tomorrow has me scratching my 
head about the “survivability” of 
it all.  But that’s the hero gig, 
right?  Part of the journey is the 
end. 

REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, 
STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching.

TONY (CONT'D)
What am I even tripping for? 
Everything is going to work out 
exactly the way it’s supposed to. 

HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and 
Morgan in particular.

TONY (CONT'D)
I love you 3000. 

He switches off the camera, vanishing.  

Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY

PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT 
RINGED WITH FLOWERS.  The Avengers follow, somber.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY

PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER.  

CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.”

Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN...

PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA... 

PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL...

PAST THOR AND SMART HULK...

PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE...

PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY...

PAST T’CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, 

TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

137


138

PAST STRANGE and WONG...

PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET...

PAST BUCKY BARNES... 

PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER...

PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY.

THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY

LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake.  WANDA approaches.

CLINT BARTON
I just wish there were some way I 
could let her know that we won.  
That we did it.  

WANDA
She knows.  They both do.

Clint puts his arm around her.  They stare out at the water.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY

ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND.

HAPPY HOGAN 
How are you doing, squirt?  You 
hungry?

MORGAN STARK
Uh, huh.

HAPPY HOGAN
What do you want?

MORGAN STARK
Cheeseburgers?

Happy takes a beat, choked up.  Like father like daughter.  

HAPPY HOGAN
Did you know your dad liked 
cheeseburgers?

MORGAN STARK
No, I didn’t know that.

138


139

HAPPY HOGAN
I’m going to get you all the 
cheeseburgers you want.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY

THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD.

VALKYRIE
So when can we expect you back?

THOR
About that...

VALKYRIE
Thor, your people need a king.

THOR
They already have one.  And she’s a 
far better king than I could ever 
be.

VALKYRIE
Are you serious?

THOR
It’s time to be who I am, rather 
than who I’m supposed to be.  And a 
leader is who you are.

She processes this.  Does she want it?  She does.

VALKYRIE
You know, I’d make a lot of changes 
around here.

THOR
I’m counting on it, Your Majesty.

Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND.  

VALKYRIE
What will you do?

THOR
I’m not entirely sure.  For the 
first time in a thousand years, I 
have no path.  
(beat)
But I do have a ride.

REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside.

139


140

ROCKET
Move it or lose it, Hairbag.

INT. BENATAR - DAY

THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar.  QUILL, 
MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines.  

THOR
Home sweet home.  Tree!  Good to 
see you.  The Asgardians of the 
Galaxy, together again.

He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. 

THOR (CONT'D)
All right, where first?

He swipes through images on the screen.

QUILL
You know, I’m still in charge, 
here, right?

THOR
Of course.  Of course...

Thor swipes the map again.

QUILL
See, when you keep swiping my map, 
that sounds kind of like, “of 
course, I know you think you’re 
still in charge-”

THOR
Quail, that’s your own insecurities 
bubbling up.

DRAX
You should fight one another for 
the honor of leadership.

NEBULA
Sounds fair. 

QUILL
That’s not necessary...

ROCKET
I’ve got some blasters right here. 
Unless you want to use knives.

140


141

MANTIS
Oh, yes, please, use knives-

QUILL
No one’s using knives!

GROOT
I am Groot!

Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter.

THOR
There’ll be no knifing young Quail 
today.  Everyone knows who’s in 
charge.

A long awkward moment passes.

QUILL
Me.
(sotto, to Thor)
Right?

Thor just smiles...

EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY

The ship rises.  WHOOSH.  IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY

CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND.  A 
COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside...

A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0).  

As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute 
adjustments.  He finally opens A CASE:

THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE.

SMART HULK
Remember, you’ll have to return the 
stones to the exact moment they 
were taken.  Otherwise, we’re still 
looking at a whole bunch of nasty 
alternate realities.

STEVE
Got it.  I’ll clip all the 
branches.  

141


142

Steve takes the case.

SMART HULK
You know, I tried.  When I had the 
gauntlet.  I really tried to bring 
her back. 
(beat)
I miss her.

STEVE
Me, too. 

SMART HULK
You’d better get going.  We’re 
almost ready for you.

Steve and Sam approach the platform.  

SAM WILSON
You look a little nervous going by 
yourself.  Ask nicely, I’ll go with 
you. 

STEVE
You’re a good man, Sam.  But this 
one’s on me.

When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get 
back, okay?

BUCKY BARNES
How can I?  You’re taking all the 
stupid with you.

Steve grins.  Bucky gives him a long hug.

BUCKY BARNES (CONT'D)
Gonna miss you, buddy.

STEVE
It’s going to be okay, Buck.

Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform.

SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE.

SAM WILSON 
How long’s this gonna take?

142


143

SMART HULK
For him, as long as he needs.  For 
us, five seconds.  
(calling out)
Ready, Cap?  You’re good to go.  
Meet you right back here, okay?

Steve glances at Bucky as he answers.

STEVE
You bet.

SMART HULK
Going Quantum in three, two, one.

STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING.  

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Aaand, returning in five... 
four...three...two...one-

Silence.  Nothing happens.

SAM WILSON 
Where is he?

SMART HULK
I don’t know.  He blew past our 
time stamp.  He should be here.  

SAM WILSON
Get him back!  

SMART HULK
I’m trying. 

SAM WILSON
Get him the hell back-

SMART HULK
I’M TRYING!

Just then...Bucky looks out to the water.

BUCKY BARNES
Sam.

Sam turns...

EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS

Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river.  
There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.

143


144

Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY.

SAM WILSON
Hey, Cap.

The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112.

OLD STEVE
Hi, Sam.

SAM WILSON
Something go wrong...or something 
go right?

OLD STEVE
I thought, after everything that’s 
happened...maybe I should try out 
some of that life Tony always told 
me to get. 

SAM WILSON
How was it?

Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face.

OLD STEVE
It was beautiful.  

SAM WILSON
I’m happy for you.  Really.

OLD STEVE
Thanks.

SAM WILSON
Only thing bumming me out is now I 
live in a world without Captain 
America.

Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam.

OLD STEVE
That’s kind of why I’m here.

Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD.

SAM WILSON
Where did you even get this?

OLD STEVE
I had a little time to travel. 
(beat)
Try it on.

144


145

Sam hesitates.  He glances back at Bucky, who nods.  Then Sam 
picks up the shield...and puts it on.

OLD STEVE (CONT'D)
How does it feel?

SAM WILSON
Like it’s someone else’s.

OLD STEVE
It isn’t.

Sam tries to check his emotion.  He shakes Steve’s hand.

SAM WILSON
Thank you.  I’ll try my best.

Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s.

OLD STEVE
That’s why it’s yours.

Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING.

SAM WILSON
You gonna tell me about her?

Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life.

OLD STEVE
Nope.  I don’t think I will.

toe.  She laughs.  As they turn, we get a good look at...
