THE OTHER,"The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world, a human world. They would wield its power."
THE OTHER,But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force...
THE OTHER,"...our Chitauri, will follow. The world will be his...the universe, yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"
INTERCOM VOICE,"All personnel, evacuation order has been confirmed. Proceed to your designated vehicles..."
INTERCOM VOICE,...for all campus evacuation.
INTERCOM VOICE,This is not a drill. Emergency personnel proceed to your designated vehicles for all campus evacuation.
FURY,How bad is it?
AGENT COULSON,"That’s the problem, sir. We don’t know."
AGENT COULSON,Doctor Selvig read an...
AGENT COULSON,...energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
FURY,NASA didn’t authorize Selvig could go to test B.
AGENT COULSON,He wasn’t testing it. He wasn’t even in the room. Spontaneous event.
MARIA HILL,It just turned itself on?
FURY,Where are the energy levels now?
AGENT COULSON,Climbing. When Selvig couldn’t shut it down we ordered evac.
FURY,How long to get everyone out?
AGENT COULSON,Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
FURY,Do better.
MARIA HILL,"Sir, evacuation may be futile. "
FURY,We should tell them to go back to sleep?
MARIA HILL,If we can’t control the Tesseract’s energy there may not be a minimum safe distance.
FURY,I need you to make sure the Phase Two prototypes are shipped out.
MARIA HILL,"Sir, is that really a priority right now? "
FURY,Until such time as the world ends we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase Two on a truck and gone.
MARIA HILL,"Yes, Sir. With me."
FURY,"Talk to me, Doctor. "
SELVIG,Director.
FURY,Is there anything we know for certain?
SELVIG,The Tesseract is misbehaving.
FURY,Is that supposed to be funny?
SELVIG,"No, it’s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she’s misbehaving. "
FURY,How soon can you pull the plug?
SELVIG,"She’s an energy source. We turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level- "
FURY,"We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space. "
SELVIG,"We don’t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. She’s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of Gamma radiation. "
FURY,That can be harmful. Where’s agent Barton?
SELVIG,"The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual."
FURY,Agent Barton. Report.
FURY,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
BARTON,I see better from a distance.
FURY,Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?
NASA SCIENTIST,Doctor! It’s spiking again.
BARTON,"No one’s come and gone. And Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM. If there’s any tampering, sir, it wasn’t this end."
FURY,At this end?
BARTON,"Yeah. The Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides."
SELVIG,What’s that?
FURY,"Sir, please put down the spear!"
LOKI,You have heart.
LOKI,Please don’t. I still need that.
FURY,This doesn’t have to get any messier.
LOKI,"Of course it does. I’ve come too far for anything else. I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose."
SELVIG,"Loki, brother of Thor? "
FURY,We have no quarrel with your people.
LOKI,An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
FURY,You planning to step on us?
LOKI,"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. "
FURY,Free from what?
LOKI,"Freedom. Freedom is life’s great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart you will know peace."
FURY,"Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think you mean the other thing. "
BARTON,"Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. "
FURY,Like the pharaohs of old.
SELVIG,He’s right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. We’ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
LOKI,Well then.
BARTON,We need this vehicles.
MARIA HILL,Who’s that?
BARTON,Didn’t tell me.
FURY,Hill!
FURY,Do you copy?
FURY,Barton...has turned.
FURY,Get the Tesseract. Shut them down.
AGENT COULSON,"Let’s just go. No-no-no! Leave it, leave it. GO!"
AGENT COULSON,"We’re clear upstairs, sir..."
AGENT COULSON,...We need to go.
AGENT COULSON,Director.
AGENT COULSON,"Director Fury, do you copy? "
FURY,The Tesseract is with a hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
MARIA HILL,A lot of men still under. Don’t know how many survivors.
FURY,Sound a general call. I want every living soul...
FURY,...not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
MARIA HILL,Roger that.
FURY,"Coulson, get back to base. "
FURY,This is a level seven.
FURY,As of right now...
FURY,We are at war.
AGENT COULSON,What do we do?
GEORGI LUCHKOV,This isn’t how I wanted this evening to go.
NATASHA,I know how you wanted this evening. Believe me this is better.
GEORGI LUCHKOV,"Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes?"
GEORGI LUCHKOV,Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo?
NATASHA,I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.
GEORGI LUCHKOV,"Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow is just another pretty face. "
NATASHA,You really think I’m pretty?
GEORGI LUCHKOV,Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well...You may have to write it.
WEASELLY THUG,It’s for her.
GEORGI LUCHKOV,You listen carefully-
AGENT COULSON,"You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.  We need you to come in. "
NATASHA,Are you kidding? I’m working.
AGENT COULSON,This takes precedence.
NATASHA,"I’m in the middle of an interrogation, and this moron is giving me everything. "
GEORGI LUCHKOV,I not- give everything.
NATASHA,"Look, you can’t pull me out of this right now. "
AGENT COULSON,Natasha...Barton’s been compromised.
NATASHA,Let me put you on hold.
NATASHA,Where’s Barton now?
AGENT COULSON,We don’t know.
NATASHA,But he’s alive?
AGENT COULSON,"We think so.  We’ll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. "
NATASHA,"Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. "
AGENT COULSON,Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big guy.
NATASHA,My God.
CALCUTTA WOMAN,Who are you? Get out! There is sickness here!
YOUNG GIRL,Are you the doctor? I need a doctor. My father. My father’s not waking up! He has a fever and he’s moaning but his eyes won’t open.
BANNER,Slow down.
YOUNG GIRL,My father-
BANNER,Like them?
YOUNG GIRL,Please!
BANNER,Should have got paid upfront Banner.
NATASHA,"You know, for a man who’s supposed to be..."
NATASHA,"...avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. "
BANNER,Avoiding stress isn’t the secret.
NATASHA,Then what is it? Yoga?
BANNER,And you brought me to the end of the city. Smart.  I- uh- I assume the whole place is surrounded.
NATASHA,Just you and me.
BANNER,"And your actress buddy? She a spy too, they start that wrong? "
NATASHA,I did.
BANNER,Who are you?
NATASHA,Natasha Romanoff.
BANNER,"Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going to work out for everyone. "
NATASHA,"No, no. Of course not. I’m here on behalf of SHIELD. "
BANNER,SHIELD. How’d they find me?
NATASHA,"We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. "
BANNER,Why?
NATASHA,Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in.
BANNER,What if I say no?
NATASHA,I’ll persuade you. 
BANNER,And what if the- Other Guy says no?
NATASHA,You’ve been more than a year without an incident. I don’t think you want to break that streak.
BANNER,"Well, I don’t every time get what I want. "
NATASHA,"Doctor, we’re facing a potential global catastrophe. "
BANNER,Oh those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA,This  is the Tesseract.  It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
BANNER,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
NATASHA,"He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be. "
BANNER,So Fury isn’t after the monster?
NATASHA,Not that he’s told me.
BANNER,And he tells you everything?
NATASHA,"Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. "
BANNER,He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA,No one’s going to put you in a-
BANNER,STOP LYING TO ME!  I’m sorry. That was mean. I just wanted to see what you’d do.  Why don’t we do this the easy way where you don’t use that and the- Other Guy doesn’t make a mess? Okay?....Natasha.
NATASHA,Stand down. We’re good here.
BANNER,Just you and me?
COUNCILMAN,"This is out of line, Director. You’re dealing with forces you can’t control. "
FURY,"You ever been in a war, councilman? In a fire fight? Did you feel an over abundance of control? "
COUNCILMAN,You’re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?
FURY,"Not Asgard, Loki. "
COUNCILWOMAN,"He can’t be working alone. What about the other one, his brother? "
FURY,Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile. But he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. It’s up to us.
COUNCILMAN,"Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose. "
FURY,Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy is. We need a response team.
COUNCILMAN,The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
FURY,This isn’t about the Avengers.
COUNCILMAN,We’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks.
FURY,"I’m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need. "
COUNCILWOMAN,You believe!
COUNCILMAN,"War isn’t won by sentiment, Director. "
FURY,"No, It’s won by soldiers."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,There’s not enough time. I gotta put her in the water.
PEGGY CARTER,You won’t be alone.
SCIENTIST,Oh my God. This guy’s still alive.
FURY,Trouble sleeping?
STEVE,"Slept for seventy years, Sir. I think I’ve had my fill."
FURY,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. "
STEVE,"When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up- they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost. "
FURY,"We’ve made some mistakes along the way, some very recently. "
STEVE,"You here with a mission, Sir? "
FURY,I am.
STEVE,Trying to get me back in the world?
FURY,Trying to save it.
STEVE,HYDRA’s secret weapon.
FURY,Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs.
STEVE,Who took it from you?
FURY,He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
STEVE,At this point I doubt anything would surprise me.
FURY,Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
STEVE,You should have left it in the ocean.
IRON MAN,Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.
PEPPER,You disconnected the transmission lines? Are we off the grid?
TONY,Stark Tower’s about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
PEPPER,"Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works."
TONY,I assume. Light her up.
PEPPER,How does it look?
TONY,Like Christmas...
TONY,...but with more- me.
PEPPER,We’ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press.
PEPPER,I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on the zoning for the next three buildings.
TONY,"Pepper, you’re killing me at the moment. Remember, enjoy the moment. "
PEPPER,Then get in here and I will.
JARVIS,"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. "
TONY,I’m not in. I’m actually out.
JARVIS,"Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting. "
TONY,"Grow a spine, JARVIS. I got a date."
PEPPER,Levels are holding steady- I think.
TONY,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which leads me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?"
PEPPER,"Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know now would I? "
TONY,What do you mean? All this came from you.
PEPPER,"No, all this came from that."
TONY,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself- twelve percent of the credit. "
PEPPER,Twelve percent?
TONY,An argument can be made for fifteen.
PEPPER,Twelve percent of my baby?
TONY,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things and sorry but, the security snafu? That was on you. "
PEPPER,Oh!
TONY,My private elevator.
PEPPER,You mean our elevator.
TONY,"Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I’m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later aren’t I? "
PEPPER,Not gonna be that subtle.
TONY,"I’ll tell you what, next building is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower. "
PEPPER,On the lease!
TONY,"Call your mum, can you bunk over? "
JARVIS,"Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden. "
TONY,Ah-
AGENT COULSON,"Mr. Stark, we need to talk. "
TONY,You have reached the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a message.
AGENT COULSON,This is urgent.
TONY,Then leave it urgently.  Security breach. That’s on you!
PEPPER,Phil! Come in!
TONY,Phil?
AGENT COULSON,I can’t stay.
TONY,"Uh, his first name is Agent. "
PEPPER,"Come on in, we’re celebrating. "
TONY,Which is why he can’t stay.
AGENT COULSON,"We need you to look this over, as soon as possible."
TONY,I don’t like being handed things.
PEPPER,"That’s fine because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade. Thank you. "
TONY,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
AGENT COULSON,This isn’t a consultation.
PEPPER,Is this about the Avengers?  Which I know nothing about.
TONY,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t even qualify. "
PEPPER,I didn’t know that either.
TONY,"Yeah, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others. "
PEPPER,That I did know.
AGENT COULSON,This isn’t about personality profiles anymore.
TONY,"Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec? "
PEPPER,Half a moment.
TONY,"You know, I thought we were having a moment. "
PEPPER,I was having twelve percent of a moment.  This seems serious. Phil looks pretty shaken.
TONY,How would you notice- why is he Phil?
PEPPER,What is all this?
TONY,This is- ah... ...this!
PEPPER,I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight.
TONY,Tomorrow.
PEPPER,You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
TONY,"Well, what if I didn’t? "
PEPPER,"If you didn’t? You mean when you finished? Well, um, then-"
TONY,Square deal. Fly safe. They kiss.
PEPPER,"Work hard.  So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia? "
AGENT COULSON,I can drop you off.
PEPPER,"Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear about the ah- cellist, is that still a thing?"
AGENT COULSON,She moved back to Portland.
PEPPER,What?...Boo.
FACELESS PILOT,"We’re about forty minutes out from home base, Sir."
STEVE,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me? "
AGENT COULSON,A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought Gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine’s original formula.
STEVE,"Didn’t really go his way, did it? "
AGENT COULSON,"Not so much. When he’s not that thing though, guy’s like a Stephen Hawking. He’s like a- smart person. I gotta say- it’s an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present, while you were unconscious from-the-ice."
AGENT COULSON,You know it’s really- it’s just a- just a huge honor to have you on board- it’s...
STEVE,"Well, I hope I’m the man for the job. "
AGENT COULSON,"Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. "
STEVE,The uniform? Aren’t the stars and stripes a little...old-fashioned?
AGENT COULSON,"Everything that’s happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned."
THE OTHER,The Chitauri grow restless.
LOKI,Let them goad themselves. I will lead them in a glorious battle.
THE OTHER,Battle? Against the meager might of Earth.
LOKI,Glorious not lengthy- if your force is as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER,"You question us? You question him? He who out the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? When you were cast out- defeated! "
LOKI,"I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed. "
THE OTHER,"Your ambition is little, full of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. "
LOKI,"You don’t have the Tesseract yet.  I don’t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. "
THE OTHER,"You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain."
AGENT COULSON,Agent Romanoff- Captain Rogers.
STEVE,Ma’am.
NATASHA,Hi. They need you on the bridge; they’re starting the face trace.
AGENT COULSON,See you there.
NATASHA,"It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. Thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? "
STEVE,Trading cards?
NATASHA,They’re vintage. He’s very proud.
STEVE,Doctor Banner.
BANNER,"Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be coming. "
STEVE,Word is you can find the Cube.
BANNER,Is that the only word on me?
STEVE,Only word I care about.
BANNER,"Must be strange for you, all of this. "
STEVE,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar. "
NATASHA,"Gentlemen, you might wanna step inside in a minute. It’s gonna get a little had to breathe. "
HELICARRIER INTERCOM,Flight Mode. Secure the deck.
STEVE,Is this a submarine?
BANNER,"Really, they want me in a submerged pressurized metal container?  Oh no, this is much worse."
CARRIER BRIDGE TECH 1,"Maximum performance take off, increase output to capacity. "
FEMALE CARRIER BRIDGE TECH,Power plant performing at capacity. We are clear.
MARIA HILL,"All engines operating. SHIELD emergency protocol one nine three point six in effect. We’re at level, sir. "
FURY,Good! Let’s vanish.
MARIA HILL,Engage retro reflection panels.
MALE AGENT,Reflection panels engaged.
FURY,"Gentlemen.  Doctor, thank you for coming."
BANNER,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, um, how long am I staying? "
FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind. "
BANNER,Well where are you with that?
AGENT COULSON,"We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us. "
NATASHA,It’s still not gonna find them in time.
BANNER,You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to?
FURY,How many are there?
BANNER,"Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? "
FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please?"
NATASHA,"You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. "
BANNER,Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four?
NATASHA,I’m not sure-
BANNER,Oh you’re very young.
FURY,"Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised? "
MARIA HILL,Was that not procedure?
MARIA HILL,Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team?
FURY,Doesn’t appear that I have to.
SELVIG,Put it over there. Where did you find all these people?
BARTON,"SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need? "
SELVIG,"Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of. "
BARTON,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
SELVIG,"Well, I didn’t know. Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth. "
LOKI,"I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. What did it show you Agent Barton? "
BARTON,My next target.
SELVIG,"Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in. "
BARTON,"Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube."
LOKI,I see why Fury chose you to guard it.
BARTON,"You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team. "
LOKI,Are they a threat?
BARTON,"To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way. "
LOKI,You admire Fury.
BARTON,He’s got a clear line of sight.
LOKI,Is that why you failed to kill him?
BARTON,"It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun. "
LOKI,"I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it. "
BARTON,That’s a risk
LOKI,Oh yes.
BARTON,If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful.
LOKI,Tell me what you need.
BARTON,I need a distraction. And an eyeball.
AGENT COULSON,"I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. "
STEVE,"No-no, it’s fine. "
AGENT COULSON,"It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but- "
AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Wait- cross-match, seventy nine percent. "
AGENT COULSON,Location?
AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty eight, Königstraße. He’s not exactly hiding. "
FURY,"Captain, you’re up."
LOKI,"Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL!  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel."
GERMAN OLD MAN,Not to men like you.
LOKI,There are no men like me.
GERMAN OLD MAN,There are always men like you.
LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. "
LOKI,The soldier- the man out of time.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,I’m not the one who’s out of time.
NATASHA,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down."
LOKI,Kneel!
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Not today.
NATASHA,Guy’s all over the place.
TONY,"Agent Romanoff, you miss me?"
IRON MAN,Make a move reindeer games. Good move.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Mister Stark.
IRON MAN,Captain.
FURY,He saying anything?
NATASHA,Not a word.
FURY,"Just get him here, we’re low on time. "
STEVE,I don’t like it.
TONY,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
STEVE,I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
TONY,"Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates? "
STEVE,What?
TONY,"It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle. "
STEVE,Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in.
TONY,"Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you."
NATASHA,Where’s this come from?
STEVE,What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening?
LOKI,I’m not overly fond of what follows. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA,What are you doing?
IRON MAN,Now there’s that guy.
NATASHA,Another Asgardian?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,That guy’s a friendly.
NATASHA,"Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki, or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, we need a plan of attack. "
IRON MAN,I have a plan. Attack!
NATASHA,"I’d sit this one out, Cap. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,I don’t see how I can.
NATASHA,"These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that."
THOR,Where is the Tesseract?
LOKI,"Oh-ho, I missed you too. "
THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth."
THOR,I thought you dead.
LOKI,Did you mourn?
THOR,We all did. Our father-
LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? "
THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? "
LOKI,"I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king! "
THOR,"So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. "
LOKI,Well yes.
THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill."
LOKI,"I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it- "
THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
LOKI,I am a king!
THOR,Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
LOKI,I don’t have it.  You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where.
THOR,You listen well brother-
LOKI,I’m listening?
THOR,Do not touch me again.
TONY,Then don’t take my stuff.
THOR,You have no idea what you’re dealing with.
TONY,Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes?
THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. "
TONY,"He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours."
IRON MAN,-stay out of the way. Tourist.
TONY,Okay! 
JARVIS,Power at four hundred percent capacity.
TONY,How bout that?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Hey!
CAPTAIN AMERICA,That’s enough!  Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here-
THOR,I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes!
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
IRON MAN,"Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer- "
THOR,You want me to put hammer down?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Are we done here?
FURY,"In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? Ant. Boot. "
LOKI,"It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. "
FURY,Built for something a lot stronger than you.
LOKI,"Oh I’ve heard. A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? "
FURY,"How desperate am I?... You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. "
LOKI,"Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? A... warm light for all mankind to share? And then to be reminded what real power is."
FURY,"Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something. "
BANNER,He really grows on you doesn’t he?
STEVE,"Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? "
THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. "
STEVE,"An army, from outer space? "
BANNER,"So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. "
THOR,Selvig?
BANNER,He’s an astrophysicist.
THOR,He’s a friend.
NATASHA,Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours.
STEVE,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here.
BANNER,"I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. "
THOR,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. "
NATASHA,He killed eighty people in two days.
THOR,He’s adopted?
BANNER,"I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?"
TONY,"It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing."
TONY,"Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? "
MARIA HILL,He turns!
TONY,"Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. "
MARIA HILL,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
TONY,"Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? "
STEVE,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
BANNER,He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
TONY,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. "
BANNER,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. "
TONY,Finally. Someone who speaks English.
STEVE,Is that what just happened?
TONY,"It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. "
BANNER,...Thanks.
FURY,Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.
STEVE,I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
FURY,"I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. "
THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand-
STEVE,I do!
STEVE,I...I understood that reference.
TONY,"Shall we play, Doctor? "
BANNER,"This way, sir."
BANNER,The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.
TONY,If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.
BANNER,All I packed was a toothbrush.
TONY,"You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. "
BANNER,Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.
TONY,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. "
BANNER,Ow!
STEVE,Hey!
TONY,Nothing?
STEVE,Are you nuts?
TONY,"Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? "
STEVE,Is everything a joke to you?
TONY,Funny things are.
STEVE,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. "
BANNER,No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.
TONY,"You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. "
STEVE,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. "
TONY,"You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. "
STEVE,You think Fury’s hiding something?
TONY,"He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? "
BANNER,"Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- "
STEVE,Doctor?
BANNER,"A warm light for all mankind,"" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. "
STEVE,I heard it.
BANNER,"Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. "
STEVE,The Stark Tower? That big ugly building in New York?
BANNER,"It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? "
TONY,"It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. "
BANNER,"So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? "
TONY,I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.
STEVE,I’m sorry did you say-
TONY,JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?
STEVE,Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.
TONY,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. "
STEVE,"I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. "
TONY,Following’s not really my style.
STEVE,"And you’re all about style, aren’t you? "
TONY,"Out of the people in this room, which one is ""A"" wearing a spangly outfit and ""B"" not of use? "
BANNER,"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? "
STEVE,Just find the Cube.
TONY,That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.
BANNER,"Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. "
TONY,"What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. "
BANNER,I’ll read all about it.
TONY,"Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. "
BANNER,"Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. "
TONY,"You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. "
BANNER,But you can control it.
TONY,Because I learned how.
BANNER,It’s different. 
TONY,"Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. "
BANNER,So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?
TONY,I guess we’ll find out.
BANNER,You may not enjoy that.
TONY,And you just might.
AGENT COULSON,As soon as Loki took the doctor we...
AGENT COULSON,"...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe. "
THOR,Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.
AGENT COULSON,He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.
THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. "
AGENT COULSON,Like what?
THOR,"Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? "
AGENT COULSON,No.
THOR,"Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.  When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. "
FURY,War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?
THOR,"I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. "
FURY,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. "
THOR,What are you asking me to do?
FURY,"I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? "
THOR,Loki is a prisoner.
FURY,Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
LOKI,Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me.
NATASHA,But you figured I’d come.
LOKI,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. "
NATASHA,I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton.
LOKI,I’d say I’ve expanded his mind.
NATASHA,And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?
LOKI,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff? "
NATASHA,Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
LOKI,Tell me.
NATASHA,"Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. "
LOKI,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
NATASHA,Not let you out.
LOKI,"Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? "
NATASHA,"Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was. "
LOKI,And what are you now?
NATASHA,It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.
LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic."
LOKI,...You lie and kill in the service of liars...
LOKI,"...and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code..."
LOKI,"...something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away."
LOKI,"I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.  And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! "
NATASHA,You’re a monster!
LOKI,"Oh, no. You brought the monster."
NATASHA,"So, Banner? That’s your play. "
LOKI,What?
NATASHA,"Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you, for your cooperation!"
FURY,"What are you doing, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,Uh- kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
FURY,You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
BANNER,"We are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile. "
TONY,"And you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is Phase Two?"
STEVE,"Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons. Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me. "
FURY,"Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we’re- "
TONY,"I’m sorry, Nick.  What were you lying? "
STEVE,"I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit."
BANNER,Did you know about this?
NATASHA,"You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? "
BANNER,"I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. "
NATASHA,Loki’s manipulating you.
BANNER,And you’ve been doing what exactly?
NATASHA,You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
BANNER,"Yes, and I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. "
BANNER,I’d like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
FURY,Because of him.
THOR,Me?
FURY,"Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly- hilariously, out-gunned. "
THOR,My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
FURY,"But you’re not the only people out there, are you? And, you’re not the only threat. The world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled. "
STEVE,Like you controlled the cube!
THOR,"Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR. "
STEVE,A higher form?!
FURY,You forced our hand! We had to come up with some-
TONY,Nuclear deterrent! ’Cause that always calms everything right down.
FURY,"Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? "
STEVE,"I’m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep- "
TONY,Wait-Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?
STEVE,"I’m sorry, isn’t everything? "
THOR,I thought humans were more evolved than this.
FURY,"Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up? "
THOR,Tis your champion.
FURY,YOU’RE NOT MY CHAMPION!
NATASHA,Are you boys really that naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats.
TONY,You furious? I’m furious.
BANNER,And Captain America is on the threat poll?
NATASHA,We all are!
FURY,That’s not your concern doctor!
TONY,You’re on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?
STEVE,"I swear to God, Stark, one more crack... "
TONY,You’re a threat. VERBAL THREAT! I FEEL THREATENED!
STEVE,SHOW SOME RESPECT.
TONY,RESPECT WHAT!
BANNER,"YEAH MAN HANDLE ME NOW, THAT’LL BE GOOD!"
INTERCOM VOICE,Transport six-six-five-oh. Please relay your form code. Got you on the computer but not on the data log. What is your haul? Over.
PILOT,Arms to ammunition. Over.
THOR,"You speak of control, yet you court chaos! "
BANNER,"It’s his MO, isn’t it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We’re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We’re- we’re a time bomb. "
FURY,You need to step away.
TONY,Why shouldn’t they guy let off a little steam?
STEVE,You know damn well why! Back off!
TONY,"Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me. "
STEVE,"Yeah, big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you? "
TONY,"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. "
STEVE,"I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. "
TONY,I think I would just cut the wire.
STEVE,"Always a way out. You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero. "
TONY,"A hero, like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle."
STEVE,"Put on the suit, let’s go a few rounds. "
THOR,"You people are so petty, and tiny. "
BANNER,"Yeah, this is a team. "
FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his- "
BANNER,WHERE? YOU RENTED MY ROOM!
FURY,The cell was just-
BANNER,"IN CASE YOU NEEDED TO KILL ME. BUT YOU CAN’T, I KNOW, I TRIED!  I got low. I didn’t see an end so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?"
STEVE,"Doctor Banner, put down the scepter."
FURY,Got it!
BANNER,"Sorry, kids. You don’t get to see my party trick after all. "
THOR,Located the Tesseract?
TONY,I can get there faster.
STEVE,"Look, all of us- "
NOVAR,"The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it."
STEVE,You’re not going alone!
TONY,You gonna stop me?
STEVE,"Put on the suit, let’s find out! "
TONY,I’m not afraid to hit an old man.
STEVE,Put on the suit.
BANNER,Oh-my-god.
STEVE,Put on the suit.
TONY,Yep.
INTERCOM VOICE,All hands engaged.
FURY,Hill!
MARIA HILL,Number Three engine is down.
FEMALE CARRIER BRIDGE TECH,We’ve been hit.
MARIA HILL,Did we get a run in? Talk to me.
OFF SCREEN WORKER,We got a fire in Engine Three.
CARRIER BRIDGE TECH 1,The line looks mostly in tact but it’s impossible to get out there to make repairs while we’re in the air.
MARIA HILL,We lose one more engine we won’t be. Somebody’s gotta get outside and patch that engine.
FURY,"Stark, you copy that? "
TONY,I’m on it.
FURY,"Coulson, initiate defensive lock down in the contingent center. Then get to the armory. "
FURY,Romanoff!
NATASHA,Okay!
NATASHA,"We’re okay, right?"
BARTON,"Keep that engine down. Detention, wait for camera to go dark. Stay close."
TONY,Find engine three. I’ll meet you there.
NATASHA,"Doctor? Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We’re gonna be okay. Listen to me."
MAINTENANCE GUY,You hurt?
NATASHA,"We’re gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never ever -- "
BANNER,Your life?
NATASHA,Bruce.
FURY,Bring the carrier to a one-eight-zero south. Take us to the water.
SHIELD AGENT,We’re blind. Navigation re calibrated after the engine failure.
FURY,Is the sun coming up?
SHIELD AGENT,"Yes, sir. "
FURY,Then put us on the left. Get us over water. One more turbine goes down then we drop.
STEVE,"Stark! Stark, I’m here."
IRON MAN,Good. Let’s see what we got.
TONY,"I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors, work on dislodging the debris. "
IRON MAN,I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.
TONY,What’s it look like in there?
STEVE,It seems to run on some form of electricity.
TONY,"Well, you’re not wrong."
THOR,"We’re not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!"
STEVE,"’Kay, the relays are intact."
STEVE,What’s our next move?
IRON MAN,"Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won’t re-engage without a jump.... "
TONY,...I’m gonna have to get in there and push.
STEVE,"Well, if that thing gets up to speed, you’ll get shredded! "
TONY,Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that should-
STEVE,Speak English!
TONY,See that red lever?  It’ll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
TONY,"Stand by it, wait for my word."
FURY,We need full evac on the lower hangar bed.
MARIA HILL,GRENADE!
INTERCOM VOICE,We’ve got perimeter breach. Hostiles are in SHIELD gear. Call out to every junction.
INTERCOM VOICE,We’ve got the Hulk and Thor on Research Level Four. Levels Two and Three are gone.
MARIA HILL,"Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart! "
FURY,Get his attention.
MARIA HILL,"Escort 6-Oh, proceed to Wishbone and..."
MARIA HILL,...engage hostile. Don’t get too close.
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT,Copy.
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT,Target acquired. Target engaged.
FURY,They are not getting through here so what the-
INTERCOM VOICE,Engine One is now in shutdown.
SHIELD WORKER,"Sir, we’ve lost all power in Engine One."
FURY,"It’s Barton, he took out our systems. He’s headed for the detention lab. Does anybody copy? "
NATASHA,This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. 
FURY,"Stark, we’re losing altitude. "
TONY,"Yep, noticed."
LOKI,Are you ever not going to fall for that?
LOKI,The humans think us immortal. Shall we test that?
AGENT COULSON,Move away please.  Do you like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don’t know what it does. Do you wanna find out?
THOR,NO!
BARTON,Natasha!
AGENT COULSON,You’re going to lose.
LOKI,Am I?
AGENT COULSON,"It’s in your nature, "
LOKI,"your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky. Where is my disadvantage? "
AGENT COULSON,You lack conviction.
LOKI,I don’t think I-
AGENT COULSON,So that’s what it does.
INTERCOM VOICE,All hands to your stations immediately.
TONY,Cap hit the lever!
STEVE,i need a minute here!
TONY,Lever! Now!
TONY,Uh-oh.
AGENT COULSON,I’m sorry boss. They got rabbited.
FURY,Just stay awake. Eyes on me.
AGENT COULSON,Oh I’m clockin’ out here.
FURY,Not an option.
AGENT COULSON,"It’s okay, boss. This was never gonna work- if they didn’t have something- to"
FURY,Agent Coulson is down.
SHIELD WORKER,A medical team is on its way to your location.
FURY,They’re here.
FURY,They called it.
FURY,"These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them.  We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming.  Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative.   The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.  Well, it’s an old fashioned notion."
SECURITY GUARD,You fell out of the sky.
BANNER,Did I hurt anyone?
SECURITY GUARD,There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
BANNER,Lucky.
SECURITY GUARD,Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.
BANNER,You saw?
SECURITY GUARD,"The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here- didn’t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella. "
BANNER,Thank you.
SECURITY GUARD,Are you an alien?
BANNER,What?
SECURITY GUARD,"From outer space, an alien? "
BANNER,No.
SECURITY GUARD,"Well then, son, you’ve got a condition."
SECURITY GUARD,"So, which one is it? "
BANNER,Sorry?
SECURITY GUARD,"Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy that, ah- sometimes blows up large? "
BANNER,You know- I’m not even sure.
SECURITY GUARD,You got somewhere to go?
BANNER,Stark Tower. I- no. Yes.
SECURITY GUARD,"I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other."
BANNER,"I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm. "
SECURITY GUARD,"Well, that’s no different than anybody else. Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either. And since I’m not likely to move on from this placement, you may as well- pilfer my ride."
BANNER,I don’t know which way to go.
SECURITY GUARD,"Your mind’s already made up, son. The rest of you will follow."
NATASHA,"Clint, you’re gonna be alright. "
BARTON,You know that? Is that what you know? I gotta go in though. I have to flush him out.
NATASHA,"You gotta level out, it’s gonna take time. "
BARTON,You don’t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? You know what it’s like to be unmade?
NATASHA,You know that I do.
BARTON,Why am I back? How did you get him out?
NATASHA,Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head.
BARTON,"Thanks.  Natasha, how many agents? "
NATASHA,"Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for. "
BARTON,Loki. He get away?
NATASHA,Yeah. I don’t suppose you know where?
BARTON,Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today.
NATASHA,We gotta stop him.
BARTON,Yeah? Who’s we?
NATASHA,I don’t know. Whoever is left.
BARTON,"Well, if I put an arrow through Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better I suppose. "
NATASHA,Now you sound like you.
BARTON,"But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? "
NATASHA,"He didn’t, I just- "
BARTON,Natasha.
NATASHA,I’ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.
STEVE,Was he married?
TONY,"No. There was a uh- cellist, I think. "
STEVE,I’m sorry. He seemed like a good man.
TONY,He was an idiot.
STEVE,Why? For believing?
TONY,For taking on Loki alone.
STEVE,He was doing his job.
TONY,He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have-
STEVE,"Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony. "
TONY,Right. How did that work for him?
STEVE,Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?
TONY,We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife.
STEVE,"Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list-"
TONY,He made it personal.
STEVE,That’s not the point.
TONY,That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
STEVE,To tear us apart.
TONY,"Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. "
STEVE,Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
TONY,"Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered....Son of-a-bitch."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Time to go.
NATASHA,Go where?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,I’ll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
BARTON,I can.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Got a suit?
BARTON,Yeah.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Then suit up.
SHIELD ENGINEER,"Hey, you guys aren’t authorized to be in here. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Son, just don’t!"
MARIA HILL,Sir.
FURY,Agent Hill.
MARIA HILL,"Those cards, they were in Coulson’s locker, not in his jacket. "
FURY,They needed the push.
INTERCOM VOICE,We’ve got unauthorized departure from Bay Six.
FURY,"They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. "
MARIA HILL,"Yes, sir."
JARVIS,"Sir, I turned off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustaining "
IRON MAN,"Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. "
SELVIG,It’s too late! She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe.
IRON MAN,Okay.
JARVIS,The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable.
IRON MAN,"Yeah, I got that.  I’m beat. "
JARVIS,"Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready for deployment. "
TONY,"Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock."
LOKI,Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.
TONY,"Uh- actually, I’m planning to threaten you. "
LOKI,You should have left your armor on for that.
TONY,"Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. You’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? "
LOKI,Stalling me won’t change anything.
TONY,"No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one. "
LOKI,"The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? "
TONY,"The Avengers. It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing. "
LOKI,"Yes, I’m met them. "
TONY,"Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here. Your brother, the Demi-God; A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them. "
LOKI,That was the plan.
TONY,"Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you. "
LOKI,I have an army.
TONY,We have a Hulk.
LOKI,"Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off. "
TONY,"Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it."
LOKI,"How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? This usually works. "
TONY,"Well, performance issues. You know? JARVIS, anytime now."
LOKI,You will all fall before me.
TONY,JARVIS. Deploy.
TONY,Deploy!
IRON MAN,And there’s one other person you pissed off! His name is Phil.
TONY,Right! Army.
THOR,"Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I’ll destroy it! "
LOKI,You can’t. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!
THOR,So be it.
NATASHA,"Stark, we’re on a three heading north east."
TONY,"What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing that park, I’m gonna lay ’em out for you."
JARVIS,"Sir, we have more incoming. "
TONY,Fine. Let’s keep them occupied.
BARTON,Nat!
NATASHA,I see ’em.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,We gotta get back up there.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, are you seeing this? "
TONY,Seeing. still working on believing...
TONY,...Where’s Banner? Has he shown up yet?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Banner?
TONY,"Just keep me posted.  JARVIS, find me a soft spot."
THOR,Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?
LOKI,It’s too late. It’s too late to stop it.
THOR,"No. We can, together."
LOKI,Sentiment!
BARTON,We’ve got civilians trapped.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Loki.  They’re fish in a barrel down there.
NATASHA,We got this. It’s good. Go!
CAPTAIN AMERICA,You think you can hold them off?
BARTON,"Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure."
NATASHA,Just like Budapest all over again!
BARTON,You and I remember Budapest very differently.
YOUNG COP,It’s gonna be an hour before they scramble the National Guard.
POLICE SERGEANT,National Guard!
POLICE SERGEANT,Does the army know what’s happening here?
YOUNG COP,Do we?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You need men in these buildings. There are people inside and they can be running right into the line of fire. You take them to the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. "
POLICE SERGEANT,Why the hell should I take orders from you?
POLICE SERGEANT,"I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. We gonna set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th street."
TONY,It noticed me... ...yay!
CAPTAIN AMERICA,What’s the story upstairs?
THOR,The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.
TONY,"Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys. "
NATASHA,How do we do this?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,As a team.
THOR,I have unfinished business with Loki.
BARTON,Oh yeah! Get in line.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Save it. Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he’s gonna need us to-"
BANNER,"So, this all seems horrible. "
NATASHA,I’ve seen worse.
BANNER,Sorry.
NATASHA,"No, we could- use a little worse. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Stark, we got him. "
TONY,Banner?
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Just like you said.
TONY,Then tell him to suit up. I’m bringing the party to you.
NATASHA,I don’t see how that’s a party.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Doctor Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry. "
BANNER,"That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry."
IRON MAN,Hold On!
LOKI,Send the rest.
NATASHA,Guys?
IRON MAN,"Call it, Captain. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we’re gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash. "
BARTON,Wanna give me a lift?
IRON MAN,"Right. Better clench up, Legolas."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"Thor! You gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow ’em down. You got the lightning, light the bastards up."
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk!  Smash!"
MARIA HILL,Sir. The council is on.
BARTON,Stark. You gotta lot of strays on your tail.
TONY,Just tryin’ to keep them off the streets.
BARTON,Well they can’t bank worth a damn.
TONY,I will roger that.
TONY,Oh- boy.
TONY,Nice call. What else you got?
BARTON,"Well, Thor’s taking out a squadron down on 6th. "
TONY,And he didn’t invite me!
NATASHA,"Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don’t close that portal. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Our biggest guns couldn’t touch it.
NATASHA,"Well, maybe it’s not about guns. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,"You wanna get up there, you’re gonna need a ride."
NATASHA,I got a ride. I could use a boost though.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,You sure about this?
NATASHA,"Yeah, it’s gonna be fun!"
NATASHA,"Turn, turn, Ah!"
BARTON,"Captain, the bank on 42nd, past Madison. They cornered a lot of civilians in there. "
CAPTAIN AMERICA,I’m on it.
CAPTAIN AMERICA,Everyone clear out!
COUNCILWOMAN,Director Fury. The council has made a decision...
FURY,"I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it’s a stupid ass decision, I’ve elected to ignore it. "
COUNCILMAN,"Director, you’re closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet-"
FURY,"That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. "
FURY,"Until I’m certain my team can’t hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. "
COUNCILMAN,"If we don’t hold them in the air, we lose everything. "
FURY,"I’d send that bird out, we already have."
NATASHA,Oh you! Hawkeye!
BARTON,"Nat, what are you doing? "
NATASHA,"Uh, a little help!"
BARTON,I got it.
LOKI,"ENOUGH! You are, all of you, beneath me! I AM GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND I WILL NOT BE BULLIED BY-"
HULK,Puny God.
SELVIG,The scepter.
NATASHA,Doctor.
SELVIG,"Loki’s scepter, the energy- the Tesseract can’t fight. You can’t protect against yourself. "
NATASHA,It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what you were doing.
SELVIG,"Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source. "
NATASHA,Loki’s scepter.
SELVIG,It may be able to close the portal. And I’m looking right at it.
JARVIS,"Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell."
TONY,"JARVIS, you ever hear the tale of Jonah? "
JARVIS,I wouldn’t consider him a role model.
COUNCILWOMAN,Director Fury is no longer in command. Override seven-alpha-one-one.
JET PILOT,Seven-alpha-one-one confirmed. We’re go for takeoff.
MARIA HILL,"SIR, WE HAVE A BIRD IN MOTION! Anyone on the deck we have a rogue bird. We need to shut it down! Repeat, takeoff is not authorized!"
FURY,"Stark, you hear me? You have a missile headed straight for the city."
IRON MAN,How long?
FURY,Three minutes. Max. Stay load can wipe out mid-town.
TONY,"JARVIS, put everything we got into the thrusters. "
JARVIS,I just did.
JET PILOT,"Package is sent. Detonation in two minutes, thirty seconds. Mark."
THOR,You ready for another bout?
STEVE,"What, you gettin’ sleepy?"
SELVIG,Right at the crown!
NATASHA,I can close it. Can anybody copy? I can shut the portal down!
STEVE,Do it!
TONY,"No, wait. "
STEVE,"Stark, these things are still coming! "
TONY,"I got a nuke coming in, it’s gonna blow in less than a minute."
TONY,And I know just where to put it.
STEVE,"Stark, you know that’s a one way trip. "
TONY,Save the rest for the turn J.
JARVIS,"Sir, shall I try Miss Potts? "
TONY,Might as well.
REPORTER,Streets in New York City have become a battle ground. The army is here trying to contain the violence but clearly it is outmatch-
REPORTER,...Billionaire Tony Stark’s Iron Man-
JARVIS,"Sorry, Miss- "
NATASHA,"Come on, Stark. "
STEVE,Close it.
STEVE,Son of a gun!
THOR,He’s not slowing down.
TONY,What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.
STEVE,We won.
TONY,"Alright, Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. You ever tried shawarma? There’s a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I wanna try it. "
THOR,We’re not finished yet.
TONY,And then shawarma after?
LOKI,"If it’s all the same to you, I’ll have that drink now."
MALE REPORTER,Despite the dev...
MALE REPORTER,"...devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack, the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers- "
MALE CITIZEN,"It’s really great knowing they’re out there, you know. That someone’s watching over us. "
FEMALE CITIZEN,"I love you, Thor! "
HUSBAND,I just don’t feel safe with those thing out there.
WIFE,It seems like there’s a lot they’re not telling us.
STAN LEE,Superheroes? In New York? Give me a break!
THE SENATOR,These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city. This was their fight. Where are they now?
REPORTER,"Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves, their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance. "
WAITRESS,"What, that this is all somehow their fault?"
WAITRESS,"Captain America saved my life. Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are, I would just- I would wanna say thank you."
COUNCILMAN 2,Where are the Avengers?
FURY,I’m not currently tracking their whereabouts. I’d say they’ve earned a leave of absence.
COUNCILWOMAN,And the Tesseract?
FURY,The Tesseract is where belongs...out of our reach.
COUNCILMAN,That’s not your call.
FURY,I didn’t make it. I just didn’t argue with the god that did.
COUNCILMAN,So you let him take it...
COUNCILMAN,"and the war criminal Loki, who should be answering for his crime. "
FURY,Oh I think he will be.
COUNCILWOMAN,I don’t think you understand what you’ve started...
COUNCILWOMAN,...letting The Avengers loose on this world. They’re dangerous.
FURY,"They surely are, and the whole world knows it. "
FURY,Every world knows it!
COUNCILMAN,Was that the point in all this? A statement.
FURY,A promise.
MARIA HILL,"Sir, how does it work now...?"
MARIA HILL,"...They’ve gone their separate ways, some pretty extremely far. We get into a situation like this again, what happens then? "
FURY,They’ll come back!
MARIA HILL,Really sure about that?
FURY,I am.
MARIA HILL,Why?
FURY,Because we’ll need them to.
THE OTHER,"The humans, they are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly and therefore cannot be ruled."
THE OTHER,"To challenge them, is to court Death."
