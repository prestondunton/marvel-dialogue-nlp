TONY,"Oh, I get it.  You guys aren’t allowed to talk.  Is that it?  Are you not allowed to talk?"
JIMMY,No.  We’re allowed to talk.
TONY,Oh.  I see.  So it’s personal.
RAMIREZ,I think they’re intimidated.
TONY,"Good God, you’re a woman."
TONY,"I, honestly, I couldn’t have called that. I would apologize, but isn’t that what we’re going for here? I saw you as a soldier first. "
JIMMY,"I have a question, sir. "
TONY,Please.
JIMMY,Is it true you’re twelve for twelve with last years Maxim cover girls?
TONY,"Excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a schedule conflict but, thankfully, the Christmas cover was twins.  Anyone else? You, with the hand up. "
PRATT,It’s a little embarrassing.
TONY,Join the club.
PRATT,Can I take a picture with you?
TONY,"Are you aware that Native Americans believe photographs steal a little piece of your soul?  Not to worry, mine’s long gone. Fire away."
PRATT,STAY HERE!
RHODEY,"GET DOWN, TONY.  GET THE --"
NARRATOR,"December 7, 1941: the day the world changed forever. President Roosevelt declares the United States will build fifty thousand planes to fight the armies of Hirohito and Hitler--"
NARRATOR,Although no such capacity to build existed...
NARRATOR,"Howard Stark, founder of the fledgling Stark Industries, answers his call to duty --"
NARRATOR,"And builds not fifty, but a hundred thousand planes."
NARRATOR,"Later, Stark’s work on the Manhattan project makes the end of the war possible."
NARRATOR,Stark Industries would go on to contribute to every major weapons system through the Cold War --
NARRATOR,But Howard Stark’s greatest achievement would come in 1973--
NARRATOR,"From early on, it was clear that Tony Stark had a unique gift--"
NARRATOR,"At seventeen he graduated summa cum laude from MIT.  Four years later, tragedy would pass the Stark mantle from father to son--"
NARRATOR,The loss of a titan.  But Tony did not let personal grief distract him from his duty --
NARRATOR,"At twenty-one, he became the youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  And with it came a new mandate --"
NARRATOR,"Smarter weapons, fewer casualties. A dedication to preserving life."
NARRATOR,Today Tony Stark’s ingenuity continues to protect freedom and American interest around the globe.
RHODEY,"As Program Manager and Liaison to Stark Industries, I’ve had the honor of serving with a real patriot, a man whose life has been dedicated to protecting our troops on the front lines.  He’s a friend. And a great mentor.  A man who has always been there for his friends and his country.  Ladies and gentlemen, this year’s ARES Award winner -- Mr. Tony Stark."
OBADIAH,"Thank you...I, uhhh, I’m not Tony Stark, but if I were Tony, I’d tell you how honored I am and...what a joy it is to receive this award. The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing -- he’s always working."
TONY,"...you think we’re having a ‘moment’ here, but this is actually the logical conclusion of several mathematical truisms. Your hypothalamus is flooding your system with a chain of proteins called peptides, so that every cell in your body is opening itself up to the happy chemical: oxytocin. "
WOMAN,That’s...wow....
TONY,Hold on a second --
TONY,"-- so now your limbic system is positively...throbbing.  A Kirlian photograph of us right now, occupying this space, would show serious subatomic particles being exchanged between us, with a rapidity that transcends-- Are you getting this?  You will be quizzed --"
TONY,"My God, what are you, they roped you into this thing too? "
RHODEY,Yeah.  They said you’d be deeply honored if I presented.
TONY,"Okay, let’s do it."
TONY,"That was quick.  Thought there’d be more of, you know, a ceremony. Maybe a highlight reel --"
TONY,Colore me up.
TONY,"My chaperone has just arrived with my Degenerate of the Year Award.  Judging from his look, I may have just peed in the kiddie pool."
TONY,"I must now take my ease, along with the House’s funds."
RHODEY,A lot of people would kill to have their name on that award.
TONY,It belongs to my old man.  They should have given it to him.
RHODEY,"What’s wrong with you?  A thousand people came here tonight to honor you, and you leave them with egg on their face.  This award means something, Tony, it’s bigger than you -- "
TONY,Hold that thought a sec.
TONY,Put it all on black.  Don’t worry -- it’s approved.
RHODEY,...you just blew three million.
TONY,Yeah.  Don’t know what was more exciting -- winning it...or the fact that I don’t care I just lost it.
RHODEY,Everything’s funny to you.
TONY,No.  You’re not funny.
RHODEY,We’ve got a hell of a day tomorrow. Can we get out of here now?
TONY,One more stop.
TONY,Of course I respect your opinion.
RHODEY,This is no joke.  You’re going into a hot zone.  We should be doing this test here in Nevada.
TONY,This system has to be demonstrated in true field conditions.
PEPPER,"Tony, it’s the President.  Wants to congratulate you personally.  Heads up."
TONY,"...Jim, how’re the trout running? Yeah, sitting on top of the world here.  Working on my masterpiece --"
PEPPER,You’re leaving the country for a week.  I need five minutes --
TONY,Okay -- shoot.
PEPPER,The Board meeting is on the eleventh.  Should I tell them to expect an appearance--?
WOMAN’S VOICE,Mr. Stark!
CHRISTINE,"Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair Magazine.  Can I ask you a few questions? "
TONY,Can I ask a few back?
CHRISTINE,You’ve been described as a Da Vinci for our times.  What do you say to that?
TONY,Ridiculous.  I don’t paint.
CHRISTINE,And what do you say to your other nickname: “The Merchant of Death?”
TONY,That’s not bad --
TONY,Let me guess.  Berkeley?
CHRISTINE,Brown.
TONY,"Well Miss Brown, it’s an imperfect world and I assure you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I’ll start manufacturing bricks and beams to make baby hospitals. "
CHRISTINE,"Rehearse that much, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,Every night in front of the mirror. Call me Tony.
CHRISTINE,"I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for a serious answer. "
TONY,Here’s serious: my old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.
CHRISTINE,"Good line, coming from the guy selling the sticks. "
TONY,My father helped defeat Hitler.  He was on the Manhattan Project.  A lot of people -- including your professors at Brown -- might call that being a hero.
CHRISTINE,Others might call it war- profiteering.
TONY,"Tell me: do you plan to report on the millions we’ve saved by advancing medical technology?  Or kept from starving with our inteli- crops?  All were breakthroughs spawned from, that’s right, military funding. "
CHRISTINE,Wow.  You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
JARVIS,"I’m sorry, Miss Everhart, you are not authorized to access that area."
PEPPER,"Don’t worry, that’s Jarvis -- he runs the house.  Jarvis: de- activate security."
PEPPER,"Here, your clothes cleaned and pressed.  Anything else I can get you? "
CHRISTINE,"Look, Tony wanted me to stay for breakfast, but I’ve got to get a jump on the day.  Call me a cab, would you? "
PEPPER,Cab’s waiting outside.
CHRISTINE,"And a coffee, hon.  Black.  One Splenda. "
PEPPER,Should I tell Mr. Stark you were satisfied with the interview?
PEPPER,You still owe me five minutes--
TONY,Five?  I’ll need a bit longer than that --
PEPPER,Focus.  I need to leave on time today.
TONY,"You’re rushing me.  What, you have plans tonight? "
PEPPER,The MIT commencement.  Yes or no?
TONY,Maybe.  Tell me your plans.
PEPPER,I’ll tell them ‘yes’.  You want to buy the Jackson Pollock?  He’s got another buyer in the wings --
TONY,What’s it look like?
TONY,"It’s a minor work in his later Spring Period, it’s ludicrously over-priced-- "
TONY,Buy it.
PEPPER,He left an hour ago.  Okay.  It’s Rhodey again.
TONY,"You have plans, don’t you --? "
PEPPER,I’m allowed to have plans on my birthday.
TONY,It’s your birthday again?
PEPPER,"Yep.  Funny, same day as last year. "
TONY,"Well, get yourself something from me.  Something nice. "
PEPPER,Already did.
TONY,And...?
PEPPER,"It was very tasteful, very elegant. Thank you, Mr. Stark. "
TONY,"You’re welcome, Miss Potts."
TONY,"Sorry, pal -- car trouble."
RHODEY,"I was standing out there three hours, what the hell --? "
TONY,I had car trouble.
TONY,"Thanks, maybe later."
ATTENDANT,"Would you like a drink, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,Two fingers of Laphroig.  You want one?
RHODEY,We’re working.
TONY,You should have a drink.  We’ve got a twelve hour flight ahead of us.
RHODEY,It’s two in the afternoon.
TONY,"It’s two in the morning where we’re going.  C’mon, ten hours “bottle to throttle --” "
RHODEY,Don’t start with me.
TONY,"Jeez, we’re not getting hammered. Just a nightcap.  We’ll sleep better, arrive fresh.  It’s the responsible thing to do. I don’t know about you, but I want to sell some weapons."
RHODEY,"You don’t get it.  I don’t work for the military because they paid for my education, or my father’s education.  Don’t cheapen it like that. "
TONY,"All I said was, with your smarts, your engineering background, you could write your own ticket in the private sector -- on top of which, you wouldn’t have to wear that ‘straight-jacket’. "
RHODEY,"‘Straight-jacket’?  This uniform means something.  A chance to make a difference.  You don’t respect that, because you don’t understand. "
TONY,"See that one?  Her I understand. Croatian.  Hot-blooded, I’m serious.  Must be those winters in Zagreb -- "
RHODEY,You’re not listening to a word I’m saying.
TONY,"I am listening.  I’m changing the subject.  It’s the same litany, every time you’ve had a thimble of alcohol.  Drink One: reflections on the New American Century and related topics -- "
RHODEY,"Something’s...seriously wrong with you, man. "
TONY,Drink 2: a history of World War II and the Tuskeegee Flyers.  Drink 3--
RHODEY,"You know, hell with you.  I’m not talking to you anymore."
TONY,"Go hang with the pilot.  You’ll get along, he’s got a personality just like yours. "
RHODEY,I will.
RHODEY,That’s funny.
TONY,You could tell?
TONY,"The age old question: is it better to be feared or respected?  I say, is it too much to ask for both?"
TONY,"With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries Freedom Line.  It’s the first missile system to incorporate my proprietary Repulsor Technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.  I prefer the one you only have to fire once..."
TONY,"That’s how dad did it, it’s how America does it, and so far its worked out pretty well. Find an excuse to fire off one of these and I personally guarantee the enemy is not gonna want to leave their caves."
TONY,"For your consideration, the Jericho..."
TONY,Now there’s one last creation I haven’t shown anyone yet.  You might be interested...
TONY,"To peace, gentlemen...and with every five hundred million, I’ll throw in a free one of these... "
TONY,"Hey, what are you doing up? "
OBADIAH,Sleeping.  How did it go?
TONY,I think we got an early Christmas coming.
OBADIAH,Sounds good.
TONY,"Hey, why aren’t you wearing the PJs I got you? "
OBADIAH,"I don’t do monograms.  I’m hanging up now, bye-bye."
TONY,"All right, who wants to ride with me?  Jimmy? "
JIMMY,Me?
TONY,"Sorry, Rhodey, no room for my conscience in here.  Or that hang- dog look.  See you back at base."
TONY,...water...water.
YINSEN,I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
TONY,What have you done to me?
YINSEN,"What did I do?  I removed what I could, but there’s a lot left headed for you atrial septum.  Do you want a souvenir?"
YINSEN,"I’ve seen many wounds like this in my village.  The walking dead we called them, because it took a week for the barbs to reach vital organs.  I anchored a magnetic suspension system to the plate. It’s holding the shrapnel in place...at least for now."
YINSEN,"That’s right, smile.  We met once -- at a technical conference in Bern. "
TONY,I don’t remember.
YINSEN,"You wouldn’t.  If I’d been that drunk, I wouldn’t have been able to stand, much less give a talk on integrated circuits. "
TONY,Where are we --?
YINSEN,Stand up!  Do as I do.  Now!
YINSEN,"Listen to me, whatever they ask you, refuse.  You understand?  You must refuse."
ABU,"Welcome Tony Stark, the greatest mass murderer in the history of America.  It’s a great honor. "
YINSEN,"He says welcome Tony Stark, the greatest mass murderer in the history of America.  He is very honored."
ABU,I want you to build this for me -- the Jericho missile you were demonstrating.
YINSEN,You will build for him Jericho missile you were demonstrating.
TONY,...I refuse.
YINSEN,"You refuse?  You will do everything he says.  This is the great Abu Bakar.  You’re alive only because of his generosity.  You are nothing.  NOTHING.  He offers you his hospitality, and you answer only with insolence  He will not be refused.  You will die in a pool of your own blood."
YINSEN,"Perfect.  You did very well, Stark."
YINSEN,"Good, I think they’re starting to trust me."
YINSEN,"Well, that’s the end of my plan."
YINSEN,"Quite a collection, isn’t it? "
TONY,How did they get all this?
ABU,"As you see, we have everything you need to build the Jericho.  You will make a list of materials and start work right away.  When we are done we will set you free. "
YINSEN,"As you can see, they have everything you need to build the Jericho.  He says make a list of materials.  You will start work right away and when you are done he will set you free."
TONY,No he won’t
YINSEN,...no he won’t.
RHODEY,Something’s not right.
GABRIEL,Looks like a standard hit and run.
RHODEY,"Sir, I’m telling you, this was a snatch and grab.  A perfectly executed linear ambush.  As soon as they got what they wanted, they melted away. "
GABRIEL,"Intel’s on it, we’re in good hands. If he’s out there, we’ll get him."
RHODEY,With your permission I’d like to stay in theater and head up the search and investigation.
GABRIEL,There’s a PR firestorm brewing over this.  Right now the best way to serve your country is to get back there and handle it.
RHODEY,"Tony Stark is the DOD’s number one intellectual asset, and I can be of value in the field. "
GABRIEL,"Duly noted, but we need you back home. Colonel, it’s not lost on me that Stark is a lifelong friend."
YINSEN,"I’m sure they’re looking for you, Stark, but they will never find you here.    That car battery is running out...and they won’t turn on the generator till you start to work."
YINSEN,"You don’t like what you saw out there, did you?  I didn’t like it either when those weapons destroyed my village.  What you just saw, that’s your legacy -- your life’s work in the hands of these murderers.   Is that how you want to go out?  Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to try to do something about it? "
TONY,"Why should I do anything, they’re either going to kill me or I’m going to die in a week. "
YINSEN,Then this is a very important week for you.
TONY,"Okay, here’s what I need..."
TONY,"S-Category missiles.  Lot 7043.  The S-30 explosive tritonal.  And a dozen of the S-76.  Mortars: M-Category #1, 4, 8, 20, and 60.  M- 229’s, I need eleven of these.  Mines: the pre-90s AP 5s and AP 16s. "
YINSEN,"S-Category missiles.  Lot 7043.  The S-30 explosive tritonal.  And a dozen of the S-76.  Mortars: M-Category #1, 4, 8, 20, and 60.  M- 229’s, he needs eleven of these.  Mines: the pre-90s AP 5s and AP 16s."
TONY,"...this area free of clutter, with good light.  I want it at 12 o’clock to the door to avoid logjams.  I need welding gear -- acetelyene or propane, helmets, a soldering set-up with goggles, and smelting cups.  Two full sets of precision tools. "
YINSEN,"...this area free of clutter, with good light.  He wants it at 12 o’clock to the door to avoid logjams.  He needs welding gear -- acetylene or propane, helmets, a soldering set-up with goggles, and smelting cups.  Two full sets of precision tools."
TONY,"Finally, I want: three pairs of tube socks, white, a toothbrush, protein powder, spices, sugar, five pounds of tea, cards.  And a washing machine.  Top load. "
YINSEN,"Finally, he needs: three pairs of tube socks, white, a toothbrush, protein powder, spices, sugar, five pounds of tea, and some playing cards.  And a washing machine.  Top load."
ABU,A WASHING MACHINE?  DOES HE THINK I’M A FOOL?
TONY,Must have everything.  Great Satan make big boom-kill for powerful Abu Bakar.  Big boom-kill. 
YINSEN,You do know they’ve removed all the explosives before they brought this to us.
TONY,"I know, they’re crazy not stupid."
TONY,This is what we’re looking for.  I need eleven of these.
YINSEN,Eleven?
TONY,Heat the palladium to 1825 Kelvin.
YINSEN,How will I know when it reaches that temperature?
TONY,The palladium will melt.
TONY,"Careful, careful... "
YINSEN,Relax.  I always had steady hands. It’s why you’re still alive.
TONY,"Oh yeah, thanks.  What do I call you? "
YINSEN,My name is Yinsen.
TONY,Nice to meet you.
YINSEN,Nice to meet you too.
YINSEN,What are you building?
TONY,A better mousetrap.
TONY,What are you shaving for?  We’re almost done.
YINSEN,"Look like an animal, and soon you’ll start behaving like one."
YINSEN,That doesn’t look like a Jericho missile.
TONY,That’s because it’s a miniature ARK reactor.  It should suspend the shrapnel in my chest and keep it from entering my heart.
YINSEN,What an original invention.
TONY,"Yeah, but this one is going to last a bit longer than a week. "
YINSEN,"It’s pretty small, what can it generate? "
TONY,Three gigajoules -- per second.
YINSEN,That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes.
TONY,Or something very big for fifteen minutes.
TONY,Let’s put it in.
OBADIAH,"Sorry, did I startle you? "
PEPPER,A little... 
OBADIAH,"This was a bad idea, I should never have let him go over there..."
PEPPER,"Hey, hey...we’ve got to be strong, he’s going to be okay."
YINSEN,"Stark, tell me what you’re doing, and I’ll tell you what I’m doing. "
TONY,Looks to me like you’re making a crappy backgammon board.
YINSEN,Crappy?  This is Lebanese cedar.
TONY,"Is that where you’re from, Lebanon? "
YINSEN,"I’m impressed you even know what this is.  How about we play, and if I win,  you tell me what you’re really making. "
TONY,“A” I don’t know what your talking about.  “B” I was the backgammon champ at MIT four years running.
YINSEN,"Interesting, I was the champion at Cambridge. "
TONY,Please don’t use ‘interesting’ and Cambridge in the same sentence. Is that still a school?
YINSEN,It’s a university. You probably haven’t heard about it since Americans can’t get in.
TONY,Unless they’re teaching.
RAZA,Relax.
RAZA,The bow and arrow was once the pinnacle of weapons technology.  It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.
RAZA,Today...whoever has the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. Soon it will be my turn...
RAZA,What’s really going on here?
YINSEN,Nothing.  We’re working.
RAZA,It’s been a long time.  Where’s the weapon?
YINSEN,He’s working very hard.  It’s very complex.
RAZA,Get him on his knees.
RAZA,Tell me what is going on?
YINSEN,Nothing!  NOTHING is going on.
RAZA,OPEN YOUR MOUTH!
RAZA,TELL ME NOW!
YINSEN,He’s building your bomb.
YINSEN,That’s twice I saved your life. Now are you going to tell me what the hell you’re really building?
YINSEN,"Finally, an idea of your own."
YINSEN,"My people have a tale, about a Prince -- much hated by his King -- who was banished to the underworld and jailed there..."
YINSEN,The evil King gave him the most difficult labor -- working the iron pits.
YINSEN,"Year after year the Prince mined the heavy ore, becoming so strong he could crush pieces of it together with his bare hands.  Too late, the King realized his mistake..."
YINSEN,When he struck at the Prince with his finest sword -- it broke in half.  The Prince himself had become strong as iron...
PEPPER,So that’s it?  Everyone’s pulling the plug and moving on...
RHODEY,There’s nothing left we can do.  If there was any indication Tony was still alive--
PEPPER,Spare me.  I read the official e- mail.  Thought maybe you’d have something different to say.
PEPPER,"If anyone could figure out how to beat the odds, it’s Tony.  If it was you over there, he’d be finding a way to get you back.  Or inventing a new one. "
RHODEY,What do you want me to do?
PEPPER,Be a better friend to him.
GENERAL GABRIEL,"What do you think you’re doing, Rhodes? "
RHODEY,"Going back there, Sir. "
GENERAL GABRIEL,"Listen, son -- it’s been three months without a single indication that Stark is still alive.  We can’t keep risking assets, least of all you. "
RHODEY,"Are you blocking my transfer, Sir? "
GENERAL GABRIEL,Any one of these guys would kill for your career.  Are you telling me you’re willing to sacrifice that to fly a bunch of snake-eaters on a desert patrol half way around the world?
RHODEY,"I am, Sir. "
GENERAL GABRIEL,Then I have one thing to say to you:  Godspeed.
GENERAL GABRIEL,As you were.
TONY,We’re ready.  A week of assembly and we’re a go.
YINSEN,Then perhaps it’s time we settle another matter...
YINSEN,"Ah, anchoring with 13-7.  You know, I have never met anyone who understands the nuances of this game like you."
TONY,Right back at ya.
TONY,You never told me where you’re from.
YINSEN,I come from a small village not far from here.  It was a good place... before these men ravaged it.
TONY,Do you have a family?
YINSEN,"When I get out of here, I am going to see them again.   Do you have family, Stark? "
TONY,...no.
YINSEN,You’re a man who has everything and nothing.
YINSEN,Your laundry’s over there.
ABU,You idiots don’t know what you’re doing with that game.
TONY,"Yeah-yeah, enjoy your laundry."
RAZA,You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
RAZA,Khalid.  Where is Stark?
KHALID,Yinsen!  YINSEN!
TONY,"It’s frozen, the systems aren’t talking to each other.  Reset! "
YINSEN,"No, they’re moving.  Very slow."
TONY,Get to your cover.  Remember the checkpoints -- make sure each one is clear before you follow me out.
TONY,YINSEN!
YINSEN,STOP!  STOP!
TONY,We could’ve made it.  Both of us. You could’ve seen your family again.
YINSEN,I am going to see them again. They’re waiting for me.
RHODEY,Saving your ass is getting to be a full time job.
TONY,Help me out of this thing--
RHODEY,"I got you, pal."
PEPPER,Thank you.
TONY,Your eyes are red.  A few tears for your long-lost boss?
PEPPER,Tears of joy.  I hate job hunting.
HOGAN,"Good to see you again, Sir. "
TONY,You do something new with your hair?
HOGAN,"Wouldn’t dream of it, Sir."
HOGAN,"Where to, Mr. Stark? "
PEPPER,We’re due at the hospital.
TONY,No -- to the office.    I’ve been in captivity for three months. There’s only two things I want to do.  I want to eat a cheeseburger. And I want to hold a press conference.
OBADIAH,See this.  Huh.  Huh.
OBADIAH,"Tony, thought we were meeting at the hospital.  You know there’s a lot of reporters in there.  What’s going on? "
TONY,You’ll see.  C’mon --
PEPPER,"You’ll have to take a seat, Sir. "
COULSON,"Oh, I’m not a reporter.  I’m Agent Phil Coulson with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division-- "
PEPPER,That’s a mouthful.
COULSON,I know. Here.
PEPPER,"Look, Mr. Coulson, we’ve already spoken with the D.O.D., the FBI, the CIA-- "
COULSON,We’re a separate division with a more...specific focus.  We need to debrief Tony about the circumstances of his escape.  More importantly--
PEPPER,"Well, great, I’ll let him know-- "
COULSON,--we’re here to help.  We’re here to listen.  I assure you Mr. Stark will want to talk to us.
PEPPER,I’m sure he will.  Now if you could just take your seat.
TONY,I...can’t do this anymore.
REPORTER # 1,You mean you’re retiring?
TONY,"No, I don’t want to retire.  I want to do something else."
REPORTER # 1,Something besides weapons?
TONY,Yes.  That’s right.
REPORTER #2,"The official report was sketchy. What happened to you over there, Mr. Stark?"
TONY,"What happened over there?  I had my eyes opened, that’s what happened. I saw my weapons, with my name on them, in the hands of thugs.  I thought we were doing good here...I can’t say that anymore."
RHODEY,"Uhh, weren’t we taking him to the hospital?"
REPORTER #2,"What do you intend to do about it, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,"The system is broken -- there’s no accountability whatsoever.  Right now, as of this second, we are freezing the sale of all Stark weaponry worldwide."
TONY,We’ve lost our way.  I need to re- evaluate things.  And my heart’s telling me I have more to offer the planet than things that blow up.
REPORTER #3,So you’re saying...what are you saying?
TONY,"In the coming months, Mr. Stane here and I will set a new course for Stark Industries.  “Tomorrow Today” has always been our slogan. It’s time we try to live up to it."
OBADIAH,"Okay, I think we’re going to be selling a lot of newspapers here. What we should take away from this is that Tony’s back, he’s healthier than ever, and as soon as he heals up and takes some time off, we’re going to have a little internal discussion and get back to you. Thank you for coming by."
PEPPER,You mean that?  Or is this some clever stock-maneuver?
TONY,Wait and see.
OBADIAH,Well that went well.  You just painted targets on our heads.  Our stock is going to take a 40 point dive tomorrow.
OBADIAH,"Tony, we are a weapons manufacturer.  Turning this company around to make baby bottles is like trying to get a bear to walk on its hind legs. "
TONY,I don’t want a body count to be my only legacy. There are other things we can do.
OBADIAH,Like what?
TONY,We could develop the Arc Reactor.
OBADIAH,This?  This was a publicity stunt. It’s not even cost effective.  We knew that before we built it. Repulsor technology is a dead end.
TONY,No it isn’t.
OBADIAH,Oh my God.  It is a miracle you are alive. What must have happened to you over there? We’re a team.  There is nothing we can’t do if we stick together -- like your father and I.  Let me handle this.  But you have to lay low.  Don’t talk to the press again.  Can you do that for me?
TONY,Yes.  Thanks Obie.
JARVIS,"Hello, Mr. Stark. "
TONY,"Hello, Jarvis. "
JARVIS,What can I do for you?
TONY,...I need to build a better heart.
JARVIS,"I’m not sure I follow, Sir. "
TONY,Give me a scan and you’ll see.
JARVIS,What were your intentions for this device?
TONY,It powers an electromagnet which keeps the shrapnel from entering my heart. Can you recommend any ugrades?
JARVIS,It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions.
TONY,What are you talking about?  That is ridiculous.  That is exactly the purpose of this invention.
JARVIS,The energy yeild of this device outperforms your stated intention by eleven orders of magnitude. You could accomplish your stated goal with the power output of a car battery.
TONY,Upgrade recommendations.  List.
JARVIS,Why are you talking to me like a computer?
TONY,Because you are acting like one.
JARVIS,Shall I disable random pattern conversation?
TONY,No.  It’s ok.  You are the only one who understands me.
JARVIS,I don’t understand you sir.
TONY,Were you always this dry?  I remember you having more personality than this.
JARVIS,Should I activate sarcasm harmonics?
TONY,Fine.  Could you please make your recommendations now?
JARVIS,It would thrill me to no end.
TONY,Ahh that’s more like it.
JARVIS,Should I begin machining the parts?
TONY,Machine away.
RAZA,Keep looking.  I want all of it.
CRAMER,Stark International: I’ve got one recommendation.  Ready?  SEELLLL! Abandon ship!  Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?
COULSON,Hello.  This is Agent Coulson with Strategic Homeland Inter-
PEPPER,Yes.  I remember.  What can I do for you?
COULSON,I’ve left a number of messages trying to get something on the books with Mr. Stark.
PEPPER,I know this is a priority for him. The next few weeks are a bit up in the air and I can’t set appointments without speaking with him first.
COULSON,Do you know when you will be speaking with him again?
PEPPER,Not Sure.
TONY,Pepper?  How big are your hands?
COULSON,What was that?
PEPPER,"Agent Coulson, I really have to go. Let me get back to you later."
PEPPER,What?
TONY,How big are your hands?
PEPPER,I don’t under--
TONY,-- just get down here.
TONY,Show me your hands.
PEPPER,What?
TONY,Just show me your hands.
TONY,"Perfect, they’re small.  I need you to help me. "
PEPPER,So that’s the thing that’s keeping you alive.
TONY,That’s the thing that was keeping me alive.  It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.
PEPPER,Amazing.
TONY,I’m going to swap them out and switch all functions to the new unit.
PEPPER,Is it safe?
TONY,Completely.  First I need you to reach in and--
PEPPER,Reach in to where?
TONY,The socket.
PEPPER,What socket?
TONY,"The chest socket. Listen carefully, because we have to do this in a matter of minutes. "
PEPPER,Or else what?
TONY,I can go into cardiac arrest.
PEPPER,I thought you said it was safe.
TONY,I didn’t want you to panic.
PEPPER,Oh my god...
TONY,Stay with me.  I need you to relieve the pressure on my myocardial nerve.
PEPPER,I don’t know how to do that.
TONY,I’m telling you.
PEPPER,Sorry...
TONY,Listen.  I’m going to lift off the old chest piece--
PEPPER,Won’t that make you die?
TONY,Not immediately.  When I lift it off I need you to reach into the socket as far as your hand can fit and gently move the housing away from my heart.  Do you know which direction that is?
PEPPER,To the right.
TONY,To my right.  Your left.
PEPPER,To the left.
TONY,Right.
PEPPER,Left.
TONY,Right.  Left.
PEPPER,How deep does this go?
TONY,Keep going.
TONY,That’s it.  Deeper.  Now press. Yes.  It’s releasing.
PEPPER,Ew!!! Pus!
TONY,"It’s not pus.  It’s an inorganic plasmic discharge.  It’s from the device, not my body. "
PEPPER,Well it smells.  Am I done?
TONY,Yes. Thank you.
PEPPER,Can I wash my hands now?
TONY,The new unit is much more efficient.  This shouldn’t happen again.
PEPPER,"Good, cause it’s not in my job description. "
TONY,It is now.
PEPPER,I don’t suppose you want to go over things?
TONY,Can it at least wait until I install my new untested ground- breaking self-contained power source and lifesaving device prototype?
PEPPER,I suppose.
TONY,Throw that thing out.
PEPPER,Don’t you want to save it?
TONY,Why?  It’s antiquated.
PEPPER,You made it out of spare parts in a dungeon.  It saved your life. Doesn’t it at least have some nostalgic value?
TONY,Pepper.  I have been called many things.  Nostalgic is not one of them.
TONY,There.  Good as new.  Thank you.
PEPPER,You’re welcome.  Can I ask you a favor?
TONY,Shoot.
PEPPER,"I don’t do well under that kind of pressure.  If you need someone to do something like that again, get somebody else. "
TONY,I don’t have anyone else.
PEPPER,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,"That will be all, Ms. Potts."
JARVIS,"Still having trouble walking, Sir? "
TONY,These aren’t for walking.
TONY,"Ready to record the big moment, Jarvis? "
JARVIS,"All sensors ready, Sir. "
TONY,We’ll start off easy.  Ten percent.
JARVIS,"That flight yielded excellent data, Sir. "
TONY,"Great.  I, uhh, think I know what this needs."
RHODEY,"Manned or unmanned, which is the future of air combat?  For my money, no drone, no computer will ever trump a pilot’s instincts. His reflexes, his judgement--"
VOICE,Why not take it a step further?
TONY,Why not...a pilot without the plane?
RHODEY,That I’d like to see.  Look who fell out of the sky...
TONY,Who wants to take these apart and put them back together?
RHODEY,All right -- let’s wrap it up.
RHODEY,I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a while.
TONY,Why not?
RHODEY,Figured you’d need a little time.
TONY,Why does everybody think I need time?
RHODEY,"You’ve been through a lot, thought you should get your head straight. "
TONY,I’ve got it straight.  And I’m back to work.
RHODEY,Really?
TONY,I’m onto something big.  I want you to be a part of it.
RHODEY,Lot of people around here will be happy to hear that.  What you said at that press conference really threw everyone.
TONY,I mean what I said.
RHODEY,No you don’t.  You took a bad hit. It spun you around.
TONY,Maybe I do need a little time.
RHODEY,All right then.  Good seeing you.
TONY,Likewise.
PEPPER,Thought you were done with weapons.
TONY,It’s a flight-stabilizer.
PEPPER,"Well, watch where you’re pointing your “fight-stabilizer”, would you? Obadiah’s upstairs -- should I tell him you’re in? "
TONY,Be right up.
TONY,This -- this is the big-big idea. It can pull the company in a whole new direction.
OBADIAH,That’s great.  Get me the design as soon as you can.  We’ve got a hungry production line that knock out a prototype in days.
TONY,"You know, I had a moment there where I was...reluctant...but I know now I made the best decision. I feel like I’m doing something... right, finally. Thank you for supporting me in this."
OBADIAH,"Listen, I have something to talk to you about.  I really wish you’d attended the last board meeting like I asked you to. "
TONY,"I know, I’m sorry. What did I miss? "
OBADIAH,The board’s filed an injunction against you.
TONY,What?
OBADIAH,They claim you’re unfit to run the company and want to lock you out.
TONY,How the hell can they do that? It’s my name on the building! My ideas that drive that company.
OBADIAH,"They’re going to try. We’ll fight them, of course. "
TONY,With the amount of stocks we own I thought we controlled the company.
OBADIAH,"I don’t know.  Somehow they pulled enough votes together.  Listen, the world doesn’t share your vision, Tony.  The more people have to lose, the more frightened they are of new ideas."
OBADIAH,"Now listen, I don’t want you to get all in knots.  You know how many times I protected your father from the wolves?"
OBADIAH,"Get back to your lab and work some magic.  You let me handle the board. Oh and Tony, no more press conferences."
TONY,Nothing to it...
TONY,All right.  Let’s get to work.
TONY,Standby for calibration.
TONY,Whoa--
TONY,We should take this outside.
JARVIS,I must strongly caution against that.  There are terabytes of calculations still needed --
TONY,We’ll do them in-flight.
JARVIS,"Sir, the suit has not even passed a basic wind-tunnel test. "
TONY,That’s why you’re coming with me.
JARVIS,I suggest you allow me to employ Directive Four.
TONY,Never interrupt me while I’m with a beautiful woman?
JARVIS,That’s Directive Six.  Directive Four: use any and all means to protect your life should you be incapable of doing so.
TONY,"Whatever floats you, Jarvis."
JARVIS,"Power: fifteen percent.  Recommend you descend and re-charge, Sir."
JARVIS,"Acknowledge, Mr. Stark--"
JARVIS,Power at five percent.  Threshold breached -- 
TONY,"Uhh, Jarvis?  JARVIS --?"
TONY,"STATUS, STATUS!  REBOOT --"
JARVIS,Temporary power restored.  Descend immediately.
TONY,"Jarvis, I think we need to chat about, uh, Directive Four. "
JARVIS,"May I remind you, the suit feeds off the same power source as your life-support.  A zero-drain of RT will likely kill you. "
TONY,"You’re a downer, Jarvis.  But I appreciate the heads-up."
JARVIS,Shall I take over?
TONY,"No, I got it, I got it --"
TONY,Perfect.  Let’s do some upgrades.
JARVIS,"That was quite dangerous, Sir. Might I remind you, if the suit loses power, so does your heart. "
TONY,"Yeah, and it doesn’t have a seatbelt either.  A few issues: main transducer felt sluggish at plus forty altitude.  Same goes for hull pressurization.  I’m thinking icing might be a factor. "
JARVIS,The suit isn’t rated for high altitude.  You’re expending eight percent power just heating and pressurizing.
TONY,"Re-configure using the gold- titanium alloy from the Seraphim Tactical Satellite.  It should ensure fuselage integrity to 50 thousand feet, while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. "
JARVIS,"Shall I render, utilizing proposed specifications? "
TONY,Wow me.
TONY,"Hm.  Bit ostentatious, don’t you think?"
TONY,"Add a little red, would you?"
REPORTER,"Tonight’s Red-Hot Red Carpet is here at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark’s third annual benefit for the Firefighter Family Fund has become the go-to charity gala on L.A.’s high-society calendar.  But this great cause is only part of the story--"
REPORTER,"--the man whose name graces the gold-lettered invitations hasn’t been seen in public since his highly controversial press conference, and rumors abound. Some say Stark is suffering from post traumatic stress and hasn’t left his bed in weeks."
JARVIS,"The work could take till morning to complete, Sir. "
TONY,Good.  I should come up for air anyway.
TONY,"Eyyy, there he is.  My man!"
TONY,"Sorry, thought you were someone else."
OBADIAH,What are you doing here?  I thought you were going to lay low.
TONY,It’s time to start showing my face again.
OBADIAH,"Let’s just take it slow, okay.  I got the board right where we want them. "
TONY,Great.
TONY,See ya inside.  Lots to talk about.
MAN,Mr. Stark.
COULSON,Agent Coulson.
TONY,Oh...was I supposed to meet you here?
COULSON,"No, but you haven’t been returning my calls.  This is serious, we need to get something on the books or I’ll have to go official on you."
TONY,"Yes, you’re right.  I’m going to handle this right now.  Let me check with my assistant."
TONY,Miss Potts -- can I have five minutes?  You look...you look like should always wear that dress.
PEPPER,Thanks.  It was a birthday present-- from you.
TONY,I have great taste.   Care to dance?
TONY,I’m sorry.  Am I making you uncomfortable?  You seem very uncomfortable.
PEPPER,"No, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone I’ve ever worked with in a chiffon dress. "
TONY,Would it help if I fired you?
PEPPER,You wouldn’t last a week without me.
TONY,I’m not so sure.
PEPPER,What’s your Social Security number?
TONY,Uh...
PEPPER,119-64-5484
PEPPER,"I’m sorry I was so uncomfortable. I hate being the center of attention like that and that’s why this one time in high school when I was supposed to be in a play... no, never mind... but you know that’s why I never like, wanted to have a big wedding... you know, because I thought everyone would be looking at me wearing a dress.  Oh, no, no... I’m not saying, like, “wedding.”  No, not like that.  I’m just saying, you know..."
TONY,Can I get you another glass of wine?
PEPPER,"A vodka martini, extra dry, with extra olives as soon as possible. "
TONY,Okay.
PEPPER,"And, Tony... "
PEPPER,I’m not a cheeseburger.
TONY,No.  You’re not a cheeseburger.
CHRISTINE,Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get a reaction from you.
TONY,How’s panic?
CHRISTINE,I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity.
TONY,"Hey, they just put my name on the invitations --"
CHRISTINE,Is this what you call accountability?
TONY,When were these taken?
CHRISTINE,"Yesterday.  Good P.R. move, you tell the world you’re a changed man, even I believed you. "
TONY,I didn’t approve this shipment.
CHRISTINE,Well your company did.
TONY,Come with me.
TONY,I made some promises I’m not going to be able to keep.  I suggest you pull all your money out of Stark Industries immediately --
OBADIAH,"Is this like a tick for you? Whenever you have a feeling, you start going to all the people who don’t trust you, who don’t protect you.  They’re going to put a spin on everything you say. "
TONY,"Wait a minute.  I got to ask you something.   I’m dead serious about this.  I’m not kidding.  Am I losing my mind or is Pepper really cute?  Do you think she’s attractive and interesting, or is it just that her hair is down? I’ve been out of the game for a while. "
OBADIAH,"Are you out of your mind.  You’re messing with the “guys in the rooms”, we’re talking about billion dollar interests, the world order -- "
TONY,I’m not worried about that right now --
OBADIAH,-- you should be.  You’ll disappear.  I can’t protect you against people like that --?
OBADIAH,DO YOU MIND?
OBADIAH,Tony don’t be so naive --
TONY,"-- naive?  I was naive before, when I was growing up and they told me don’t ever cross this line, this is how we do business.  In the meantime we’re double-dealing under the table.  We don’t even deserve to represent the United States -- "
OBADIAH,"-- Tony, you’re a child --! "
TONY,"-- you don’t believe I can turn this company around, do you --? "
OBADIAH,-- you’ve got about as much control over things as a child riding in the backseat of your father’s car with a red plastic steering wheel in your hand.
TONY,Maybe I’ll just get out of the car.
OBADIAH,You’re not even allowed in the car. I’m the one who’s filing the injunction against you.
OBADIAH,It’s the only way I could protect you.
TONY,This is going to stop.
TV REPORTER’S VOICE,"-- the ten mile drive to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into Hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness.  Simple farmers and herders, from peaceful villages, driven from their homes at the butt of Western rifles and the turrets of modern tanks.  Displaced from their lands by Warlords and insurgent groups emboldened by their newfound power -- a power fueled by high-tech weapons easily purchased with Poppy money on the black market -- and further destabilizing a fragile region which for decades has been a tinderbox of tribal feuding and ethnic hatred --"
TV REPORTER’S VOICE,"The villagers have taken shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find -- in the ruins of other razed villages, in the cold barren scrublands, or in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.  Our translator relayed to us one human tragedy after another.  A seven year old boy, thin as a scarecrow, clutching yellowed photographs and holding them out to anyone who would stop, with a child’s simple question: where are my mother and father?  A woman, begging for news of her husband, who’d been kidnapped by insurgents -- either forced to join their militia, or to be shot without reason --"
TV REPORTER’S VOICE,"With no political will or international pressure, there is little hope for these newly-formed refugees.  Refugees who can only wonder one thing: is the world watching?"
PEPPER,Are you going to tell me what’s going on?
TONY,Get my house in Dubai ready.  I want to throw a party.
PEPPER,Yes.  Mr. Stark.
TYCOON,Tony!  You never said what is the big occasion?
TONY,Ever known me to need one?
PEPPER,Well you seem back in old form.
TONY,"Life of the party -- isn’t that what everyone wanted?  Cue the fireworks in five, would you? "
DUBAI BEAUTY #1,Kinky!
PEPPER,Sure. Don’t hurt yourself.
TONY,I’ll be right back.  Why don’t you two...get started without me.
KID,Arto!  ARTO!
SOLDIER,Geneva Convention!  Article Three! Geneva Convention --
MAJOR ALLEN,Are we in there?
OFFICER,"Negative, it’s a local skirmish, green-on-green. "
MAJOR ALLEN,Anyone want to tell me what the hell I’m looking at?
OFFICER,"A drone?  An advanced robotic?  We don’t know what it is, Sir. "
MAJOR ALLEN,Get someone down here from Weapons Development -- now.
RAZA,Put me through to the boss.
TONY,"Jarvis, plot a course for home."
MAJOR ALLEN,"So what do we have here, Rhodes? "
RHODEY,"I don’t think it’s Russian, or Chinese. "
MAJOR ALLEN,Then where did it come from?
RHODEY,Let me make a call.
TONY,"Put it through, Jarvis. Yeah? "
RHODEY,"Tony, it’s Rhodey.   What the hell’s that noise? "
TONY,I’m in the convertible.  Not the best time --
RHODEY,"I need a quick ID.  What do you know about un-manned combat robotics, with air-ground capabilities. "
TONY,Never heard of anything like that. Why?
OFFICER,UAV has entered the no-fly zone--
RHODEY,"Because I think I’m staring at one right now, and it’s about get blown to Kingdom Come."
MAJOR ALLEN,Rhodes!  You got something for me?
TONY,Uhh...’kingdom come’?
TONY,This is my exit -- gotta go.
VIPER 1,Ballroom Control -- this is Viper 1 & 2 checking in.  UAV is in sight.
MAJOR ALLEN,Viper: target at 330 for 10 miles.
VIPER 1,"Ballroom, contact appears to be an unmanned aerial vehicle-- "
MAJOR ALLEN,"Ballroom copies, you are cleared to engage."
BITCHING-BETTY,Locked on!  Locked on!
JARVIS,Incoming Sidewinder in five... four...three...two...
JARVIS,"Sir, may I remind you that the suit can handle these maneuvers.  You cannot."
TONY,Jarvis -- AIR BRAKES!
VIPER 1,That was not a drone.
VIPER 2,Where the hell is it?
OFFICER,"Lt. Colonel Rhodes, I have Tony Stark calling-- "
RHODEY,Put him through.
TONY,"Rhodey, I had Jarvis run a check. I might have some info on that UAV. A piece of gear like that might exist.  Might definitely exist --"
RHODEY,"Wouldn’t happen to be red and gold, would it?"
VIPER 1,Viper 2 -- he’s on your belly! Shake him!
VIPER 2,What--?
VIPER 1,Ballroom: that is definitely not a UAV.
MAJOR ALLEN,What is it then?
VIPER 1,"I think it’s...a Man, sir."
RHODEY,Son of a bitch.  Tony--!
VIPER 1,Still there Viper 2.  ROLL!  ROLL!
JARVIS,Sir: two minutes and there won’t be sufficient power to get home.
VIPER 1,I’M HIT!
MAJOR ALLEN,"Viper 2, do you see a chute? "
VIPER 2,"Negative!  No chute, no chute--"
JARVIS,"Power critical, set course for home immediately."
VIPER 2,The UAV is going after him!  It’s attacking--!
VIPER 2,"GOOD CHUTE!  GOOD CHUTE!  You’re not gonna believe this, Ballroom... but that thing just saved his ass."
MAJOR ALLEN,Viper 2: re-engage.
RHODEY,-- WAIT --!
MAJOR ALLEN,-- TAKE THE TARGET OUT!
RHODEY,"Major, call off that Raptor.  You don’t know what you’re shooting at. "
MAJOR ALLEN,We’ll find out when recover the pieces.
BITCHING-BETTY,LOCKED ON!  LOCKED ON!
VIPER 2,"Ballroom: understand, you want me to engage the UAV?"
MAJOR ALLEN,Copy.
RHODEY,"Negative, Viper 2, disengage. "
MAJOR ALLEN,It’s not your call.  That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no-fly zone   Viper 2: you get a clean shot you take it.
MAJOR ALLEN,Viper 2.  Can you confirm the kill?
VIPER 2,"I got him good.  He went down, he was smokin’.  But I cannot confirm."
TONY,Get me home...
RAZA,Welcome.
RAZA,Compliments of Tony Stark.
OBADIAH,"If you’d killed him when you were supposed to, you’d still have a face. "
RAZA,"You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.  An insult, to me and the man whose ring I wear."
OBADIAH,I think it’s best we don’t get him involved in this.   I’ve come a long way to see this weapon. Show me.
RAZA,Come.  Leave your guards outside.
RAZA,His escape bore unexpected fruit.
OBADIAH,...so this is how he did it.
RAZA,This is only a crude first effort. But he’s perfected his design--
OBADIAH,What’s this?
RAZA,The inside of Tony Stark’s mind.
RAZA,Everything you will need to build this weapon.
RAZA,Stark has made a masterpiece of death.  A man with a dozen of these could rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.  And you dream of Stark’s throne -- we have a common enemy.
RAZA,"If we are back in business, I give you these designs as my gift.  In turn, I hope you will repay me with a gift of iron soldiers."
OBADIAH,This...is the only gift you shall receive.
OBADIAH,"Technology -- it’s always been your Achilles Heel.  Don’t worry, it’ll wear off in fifteen minutes -- but that’s the least of your problems."
OBADIAH,Crate up that armor and the rest of it.
OBADIAH,Send them to their virgins.
COULSON,Ms. Potts.  It’s Agent Coulson from the Strategic Homeland Inter--
PEPPER,"Yes, I know.  Unfortunately Tony is not going to be available to sit down with you for a while. "
COULSON,Really?  And why is that?
PEPPER,"He’s uh, there’s a...Tony won’t be-- "
COULSON,Maybe I can meet with you instead?
PEPPER,Why?  I don’t know anything.
COULSON,About what?
PEPPER,About anything.
RHODEY,Pepper.  It’s Rhodey.
PEPPER,Come in.
COULSON,I’d just like to ask you a few questions.
PEPPER,I’m really jammed right now. Booked solid for the next few weeks.  I have to go.
COULSON,"Let’s just put something on the books.  How about the twenty-eighth?  Seven PM, at Stark Industries? "
PEPPER,Great.  Perfect.  Bye.
RHODEY,How’s he doing?
PEPPER,Not so good.
RHODEY,I want to see him.
PEPPER,You can’t see him right now.
RHODEY,"What the hell is going on here? Let me in there, Pepper."
PEPPER,You want to see him?  Fine.  See what you’ve done to him.
RHODEY,Look at you...what were you thinking?
TONY,Weapons I built are being used to kill innocent people.  Can’t let that happen anymore.
RHODEY,You can’t go around and blow up stuff every time you see something you don’t like on TV.
TONY,Yes I can.
RHODEY,"You got lucky, next time they’ll blow you to pieces. "
TONY,"Next time, maybe I won’t play defense."
RHODEY,Does Pepper know about this?
RHODEY,You’ve put me in a tough spot here. What am I supposed to do?
TONY,That’s up to you.  I’ve made my choice -- I’m not going to sit on the sidelines anymore -- I’m going to fight for what’s right.
RHODEY,Don’t you get it?  It’s not up to us to decide.
TONY,That’s where you’re wrong...
OBADIAH,"Civilization, gentlemen, has been preserved by the right people having the right idea at the right time.  You are shaping in your hands, this very moment, the future of this company, and this nation. But it is imperative this project remain data-masked, that it’s existence never leave these walls. Make no mistake -- this is a ‘tool’, that in wrong hands, could jeopardize civilization as we know it."
HEAD ENGINEER,"Give us full access to the Sampson Cluster, and we’ll have you a prototype in record time. "
OBADIAH,The Sampson’s yours.  We go 24-7.
YINSEN,"Are you on the right path?  I don’t know...what does your heart tell you, Stark?"
TONY,This device will hack into Stark Industries mainframe. I need you to go to there and retrieve all shipping manifests.
PEPPER,What are you doing? Absolutely not you should be in bed...
TONY,...they’ve been dealing weapons under the table and I’m going to stop them.
PEPPER,Absolutely not. I’m not helping you with anything if you’re going to start this again.
TONY,There is nothing else.  There’s no art opening.  There’s no benefit. There’s nothing to sign.  There’s no decisions to be made.  There’s the next mission and nothing else. There’s nothing except this.
PEPPER,I quit.
TONY,Really?  You stood there by my side when all I did was reap the benefits of wholesale irresponsibility and destruction and now that I’m trying to right those wrongs and protect the people I put in harms way you’re going to walk out on me.
PEPPER,You’re going to kill yourself.  I can’t support that.
TONY,"So far so good. Pepper.  I know what I have to do. I don’t know if I can, but I know in my heart that it’s right.  And you do too.  And I can’t do it without you."
HEAD ENGINEER,There’s no technology that can power this thing.
OBADIAH,"I told you, miniaturize the ARK reactor. "
HEAD ENGINEER,"I’m sorry, Mr. Stane, I’ve tried. What you’re asking for can’t be done. "
OBADIAH,Tony Stark was able to do it in a cave -- with a box of scraps.
HEAD ENGINEER,Well...I’m not Tony Stark.
PEPPER,Make a copy of everything--
PEPPER,"What are you doing, Obadiah?"
PEPPER,Translate--
OBADIAH,What a nice surprise.
PEPPER,I...just wanted to get some of my personal stuff.  And my resume.  In case. You know how I love job hunting.
OBADIAH,How’s Tony?
PEPPER,Honestly...I don’t know.  He’s shut me out.
OBADIAH,You and everyone else.
PEPPER,"This...thing between you, it’s hurting him.  You’re the only real father Tony ever had. It would mean so much if you could just talk -- "
OBADIAH,Tony’s imploding -- it’s unfortunate.    You should consider whether you want to take that ride with him.
PEPPER,“Unfortunate?”
OBADIAH,"You know I love Tony -- but this is business.  We can’t save him, but we can save his legacy."
OBADIAH,"It’s tragic, but...Tony never really came home, did he?"
OBADIAH,"This company has a bright future, I’d like you to be a part of it."
OBADIAH,Tony doesn’t understand your value. He never did.
PEPPER,Are you...offering me a job?
OBADIAH,"Think about it.  Come on, I’ll walk you out."
COULSON,"Miss Potts, did you forget our appointment? "
PEPPER,No.  Of course not.  I’ve been very much looking forward to it.  Let’s-- -- why don’t we do this somewhere else?
TONY,"What gives, Jarvis? "
JARVIS,"You have a visitor, Sir.  Obadiah Stane is here."
OBADIAH,It’s UNOS.  Four cheese.  I just had it flown in from Chicago.
OBADIAH,I’d like you to proof-read something for me.
JARVIS,"Would you like me to spell-check it, Sir? "
OBADIAH,Can you turn him off?  All the way?
TONY,Spin down Jarvis.
TONY,Your resignation.
OBADIAH,You were right.  It’s not my company -- not my name on the building. We were a great team...but I guess this is where our paths diverge.
TONY,Pepper.  I should take that.
OBADIAH,Tony.  Please.  I’ll be out of here in a minute.
OBADIAH,We have too much history to part on bad terms.  I’d like your blessing.
OBADIAH,"Easy, now.  Try to breathe..."
OBADIAH,"You can’t mess with progress, Tony. It’s an insult to the Gods.  You created your greatest weapon ever -- but you think that means it belongs to you.  It belongs to the world."
OBADIAH,Your “heart” will be the seed of the next generation of weapons. They’ll help us steer the world back in the right direction -- put the balance of power back in our hands.  The right hands.
OBADIAH,"By the time you die, my prototype will be operational.  It’s not as conservative as yours."
OBADIAH,The sad thing is...we’re both the good guys.
RHODEY,"What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?  Slow down.  Why would Obadiah-- Where is Tony now?"
PEPPER,"--I don’t know, he’s not answering his phone.  Will you just go over there and check on him?  Thanks Rhodey."
PEPPER,I know a short cut.
COULSON,I’ll ride with her.
AGENT,Clear.
RHODEY,TONY--
TONY,Where’s Pepper?
RHODEY,"Don’t worry, she’s with the Feds. They’re on their way to Stark to arrest Obadiah. "
TONY,They’re going to need a lot more than a few Agents.  Give me hand.
AGENT,"Agents down, agents down! GET OUT OF HERE --"
PEPPER,Tony!  Obadiah’s got a whole assembly line under the Ark.  He’s inside one of them--!
TONY,Where are you--?
PEPPER,Obadiah...
PEPPER,Tony--
TONY,"Pepper, I have one thing I need to say to you:  DUCK!"
OBADIAH,"It’s miraculous, Tony, it’s your Ninth Symphony.  Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever. "
TONY,This wasn’t meant for the world.
OBADIAH,How can you be so selfish?  Do you understand what you’ve created? This will put the balance of power back in our hands for decades. Your country needs this.
TONY,What kind of world will it be when everybody’s got one?
OBADIAH,Your father helped give us the bomb.  What kind of world would it be if he’d failed us?
PEPPER,TONY -- ARE YOU THERE?
TONY,"A little busy, Pepper-- "
PEPPER,The reactor’s been it--
TONY,Get to the control room.  Shut it down--
PEPPER,How the hell do I shut it down??
TONY,Don’t.  This is our fight.
OBADIAH,"People are always going to die, Tony -- part of the chess game."
TONY,Emergency power!
JARVIS,"Sir, you’ll drain the -- "
TONY,NOW!
KID IN THE BACKSEAT,"GO, MOM!  GO -- "
PEPPER,TONY?  Where are you--?
PEPPER,I’m in the control room.  Now what?
TONY,Central panel.  Red button.  Press it.
PEPPER,"Thanks, Tony. "
TONY,What’s the delta rate?
PEPPER,1-2-5-0.
TONY,Damn --
PEPPER,Damn?!  I don’t want to hear “damn.”  GET UP HERE--
TONY,"Pepper, I’m delegating this to you. FIND A WAY!"
TONY,You know what happens when that reactor blows.  A lot of people are going to die.
OBADIAH,"It didn’t have to end like this, Tony.  You were down -- you should’ve stayed down."
TONY,You had to take my car.
RHODEY,Saving your ass is getting to be a full-time job.
TONY,Get this area evacuated!  There’s going to be a meltdown--
TONY,"Pepper, how we doing?"
PEPPER,Thanks for checking in Tony. Delta’s at 2300.  It’s not going down.
TONY,It’s too late.
PEPPER,Too late?  What’s going to happen?
TONY,It’s going to blow a crater a mile wide.  I’m coming to get you.
TONY,"Pepper, wait.  Stay put -- we’re going to overload the reactor."
PEPPER,IT’S ALREADY OVERLOADING --
TONY,"No, it’s compressing energy.  We’re going to convert the plasma core to electricity and channel it up through the roof.  Like a Tesla coil."
PEPPER,"I don’t need a science lesson, just tell me what button to push -- "
TONY,See a red submarine hatch?  A wheel -- a red wheel.
PEPPER,...no.  YES --
TONY,"Open it all the way, then standby to hit the master.  We’ve only got one shot at this. "
TONY,"Pepper, hit the switch.  PEPPER --"
PEPPER,TONY?  Which Master Switch --
PEPPER,I am so looking for another job.
TONY,Take my hand...
OBADIAH,"So this is the answer, Tony?  This is how you’re going to save the world?  It’s not in you.  Your father told me before he died, my boy doesn’t have a warrior’s heart. I should have listened. "
TONY,My father never knew me.
OBADIAH,But I do.
OBADIAH,"Goodbye, my boy... "
TONY,This is just the beginning.
PEPPER,"Here, your alibi.  You were on your yacht.  I’ve got port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from fifty of your guests. "
TONY,"Maybe it was just the two of us. On the yacht, I mean. "
PEPPER,"Focus, please."
TONY,"“Iron Man”.  Not technically accurate, since it’s mostly carbon- fiber and ceramic.  But I like the ring of it.  “Iron Man”..."
TONY,You know...that night at the concert hall.  Do you ever think about it?
PEPPER,"I don’t know what you’re talking about, Mr. Stark."
PEPPER,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark? "
TONY,That will be all Miss Potts.
RHODEY,"--I can confirm that a series of military test-prototypes were involved in the incident at Stark Industries last night.  I can also confirm that there was, for a brief time, the danger of an Ark Reactor “incident”, which was rectified without injury to the public -- and all power outages have been restored.  Here now, to answer a few brief questions, is Tony Stark."
TONY,I’ve seen the papers.  I’ve heard the reports.  That’s why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation.  The truth is--
TONY,I am Iron Man.
RHODEY,Good.  And I want a Gatling gun on the right shoulder.
TONY,--and a rocket launcher on the left?  Where are you going to store all that ammo?
RHODEY,"Who’s suit is this anyway? And do it in silver and black, would you? "
