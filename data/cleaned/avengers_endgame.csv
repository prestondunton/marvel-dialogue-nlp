CLINT BARTON,"Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there."
CLINT BARTON,"Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers- "
LILA BARTON,Why three?
CLINT BARTON,‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s too much-
LAURA BARTON,"You guys want mustard or mayo, or both?"
LILA BARTON,Who puts mayo on a hot dog?
CLINT BARTON,"We’ll both have mustard, hon!  Okay.  Draw back, deep breath..."
CLINT BARTON,"Good job, Hawkeye.  Go get your arrow. "
LAURA BARTON,Enough murder practice!  Soup’s on!
CLINT BARTON,"One sec, babe.  Be right there! We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. We’re hungry."
CLINT BARTON,"Lila?  Babe, did you see Lila- "
CLINT BARTON,"Guys?  Guys, come on... "
CLINT BARTON,Laura?
CLINT BARTON,LAURA!
TONY,Good sport.  Have fun?
NEBULA,It was fun.
TONY,"This thing on?  Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep.  If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker."
TONY,"I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these.  I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty- two."
TONY,"You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her.  She’s very practical.  And only a tiny bit sadistic. "
TONY,"The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge.  Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.  Problem is that was about...49 hours ago. "
TONY,"Which means, we’re dead in the water.  A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11."
TONY,Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago.
TONY,"Pep, I know I said no more surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one.  But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like."
TONY,"Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes.  Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately.  I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you.  It’s always you."
TONY,I couldn’t stop him.
STEVE,Neither could we.
TONY,I lost the kid.
STEVE,We...lost...
TONY,Is Pepper...?
PEPPER POTTS,"Stay here, you stay right here- "
TONY,I’m not going anywhere.
RHODEY,It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth.
NATASHA,"World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine.  But the parts that still work are trying to take a census.  It looks like he did what he said he was going to do."
NATASHA,Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth.
CAROL DANVERS,Not just Earth.
RHODEY,You sure about that?
CAROL DANVERS,You never have to ask me that.
TONY,Where is he now?
STEVE,We don’t know.  He just opened a portal and walked through.
TONY,What’s his deal?
ROCKET,He’s pissed.
ROCKET,"He thinks he failed.  Which, of course, he did.  But there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there? "
TONY,"Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear. "
STEVE,"We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing.  Tony, you fought him- "
TONY,"Who told you that?  I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.  There was no fight because he’s not beatable. "
STEVE,"Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinates- "
TONY,"I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe.  I thought I was dreaming... "
STEVE,"Tony, I need you to focus- "
TONY,"And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need.  It’s too late, buddy.  You know what I need?"
TONY,"I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- "
STEVE,"But that didn’t work out, did it? "
TONY,"I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.”  Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there.  But that’s what we do, right?  Our best work after the fact?  We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-” "
RHODEY,"Tony, take it easy... "
TONY,"I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap.  No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options.  Zero, zip, nada.  No trust.  Here.  You take this.  You find him, you put this on, and hide.  I’m fine! "
RHODEY,Bruce gave him a sedative.  Should be out the rest of the day.
CAROL DANVERS,"Take care of him.  When I come back, I’ll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir. "
STEVE,Where are you going?
CAROL DANVERS,To kill Thanos.
NATASHA,"Hey, hey, hang on.  We’re sort of a team here.  Between you and me, morale’s a little fragile. "
CAROL DANVERS,"Oh, I’m sorry.  My fault. "
CAROL DANVERS,"All right, team!  I’m going to go kill Thanos.  Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I’ll report back when he’s dead.  Great work, everybody. "
STEVE,"Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too. "
RHODEY,Do you even know where he is?
CAROL DANVERS,I know people who might-
NEBULA,Don’t bother.
NEBULA,I can tell you where Thanos is.
NEBULA,"Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me.  When he worked, he talked.  About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.  I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: “To the Garden.” "
RHODEY,You’re saying Thanos had a retirement plan.
STEVE,Where’s this garden?
ROCKET,"When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.  No one’s seen anything like it."
ROCKET,Until two days ago.
NATASHA,You’re saying he snapped his fingers again.  Where?
NEBULA,"Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soil- "
STEVE,A garden.
BRUCE BANNER,Thanos is there.  And he just used the stones.
BRUCE BANNER,"You know, we’d be going short- handed. "
RHODEY,Because he killed all our friends.
ROCKET,Are we saying they’re dead?  We’re using that word now?
RHODEY,He’s still got the stones.
CAROL DANVERS,"So, we take them.  And we use them to bring everybody back. "
BRUCE BANNER,Just like that?
STEVE,Yeah.  Just like that.
NATASHA,"If there’s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who’s not sitting here to try."
BRUCE BANNER,If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before?
CAROL DANVERS,Because before you didn’t have me.
RHODEY,"Hey, new girl.  All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where’ve you been all this time? "
CAROL DANVERS,There’s a lot of people in the universe.  And they didn’t all have you.
THOR,I like this one.
STEVE,Let’s go get that son of a bitch.
CAROL DANVERS,Trust me.  You get used to it.
ROCKET,"Okay, who here hasn’t been to space?"
ROCKET,"Oh, you’re gonna hate this. "
NEBULA,"Approaching jump in three, two..."
CAROL DANVERS,"I’ll head down for recon.  If I’m not back in fifteen, you’ll know I found him."
NATASHA,"This is going to work, Steve. "
STEVE,I know it will.  Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t.
CAROL DANVERS,"No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It’s just him. "
NEBULA,That’s enough.
STEVE,Where are they?
CAROL DANVERS,Answer the question!
THANOS,"The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation. "
BRUCE BANNER,You murdered trillions.
THANOS,You should be grateful.
NATASHA,Where are the stones?
THANOS,Gone.  Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER,You used them two days ago!
THANOS,I used the stones to destroy the stones.  It nearly killed me. But the work is done.  It always will be.
ROCKET,No...they can’t be gone...
RHODEY,He’s lying.
NEBULA,My father is many things.  A liar is not one of them.
THANOS,"Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve treated you- "
ROCKET,What did you do?
THOR,I went for the head.
GRIEVING MAN,"So, I went on a date the other day. "
JIMMY,"Good job, Bobby.  Back in the game. "
GRIEVING MAN,"Thank you, Jimmy.  First in five years.  I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about?"
STEVE,What did you talk about?
GRIEVING MAN,"Same old crap.  How much things have changed.  How much we miss the Mets.  My job, his job.  Then it got kind of quiet.  He cried during the salads. "
OLDER MAN,What about you?
GRIEVING MAN,I cried just before dessert.  But I’m seeing him again tomorrow. So...
STEVE,"That’s great.  You’ve already done the hardest part.  You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take.  To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life.  Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going."
STEVE,The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us. 
SCOTT LANG,Hello?
SCOTT LANG,Hey.  Kid.  What happened here?
SCOTT LANG,What?
SCOTT LANG,Cassie!  Cassie!
CASSIE LANG,Dad?
SCOTT LANG,Peanut?
CASSIE LANG,I thought you were gone.
SCOTT LANG,I’m sorry.  I’m back...I’m back...I’m back...
ROCKET,We boarded that “highly suspect warship” Danvers pinged.
NATASHA,And?
NEBULA,It was an infectious garbage scow.
ROCKET,So thanks for the hot tip-
CAROL DANVERS,You were closer.
ROCKET,And now we smell like garbage-
NATASHA,You get a reading on those tremors?
OKOYE,Minor subduction in the African plate.
NATASHA,Do we have a visual?  How are you handling it?
OKOYE,Nat.  It was a mild earthquake.  In the ocean.  We handle it by not handling it.
RHODEY,"I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure. "
NATASHA,"Thanks.  Carol, you’re still coming our way next month? "
CAROL DANVERS,Not likely.
ROCKET,Getting another haircut?
CAROL DANVERS,"Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory out here.  The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else.  On thousands of planets.  You might not see me for a long time. "
NATASHA,"All right.  Everybody keep keeping their eyes open.  This channel’s always active.  Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn’t, it comes through me."
NATASHA,What’s up?  Where are you?
RHODEY,Mexico.  Got some news.
NATASHA,Okay...
RHODEY,Federalés found a room full of bodies outside Juarez.  Cartel guys.  Guns still in their pants.
NATASHA,Could be a rival hit-
RHODEY,But it wasn’t.  Same MO as Marseille.  And Kiev.
RHODEY,It’s definitely Barton.
RHODEY,"What he’s done here...what he’s been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn’t want to find him."
NATASHA,Find out where’s he going next.
STEVE,I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already.
NATASHA,Come by to do your laundry?
STEVE,And see a friend.
NATASHA,Your friend’s fine.
STEVE,She leave the house today?
NATASHA,Nothing out there I particularly want to see.
STEVE,I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge.
NATASHA,In the Hudson.
STEVE,"Fewer ships, cleaner water.  Just saying, there’s still a world out there. "
NATASHA,"If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I’m about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich."
STEVE,Sorry.  Force of habit.
NATASHA,I don’t know how you do it.
STEVE,I guess I don’t know how not to.
NATASHA,"Me, neither."
STEVE,"I keep telling them, move on.  Grow past it.  And some of them actually do.  But not us. "
NATASHA,"If I move on, who does this? "
STEVE,Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.
NATASHA,"I used to have nothing.  Then I got this.  This job, this family.  And I was better because of it."
NATASHA,"And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be...better. "
STEVE,I think we both need to get a life.
NATASHA,You first.
SCOTT LANG,"Hello?  Is anyone home?  This is, uh, Scott Lang?  We met a few years ago.  At the airport? "
STEVE,This an old message?
NATASHA,It’s the front gate.
STEVE,"Scott, are you okay? "
SCOTT LANG,What?  Yes.
SCOTT LANG,Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?
NATASHA,Only to make conversation.
SCOTT LANG,"Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe.  You can only get there if you’re incredibly small.  Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out.  But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there. "
NATASHA,I’m sorry.  It must’ve been a long five years.
SCOTT LANG,"Okay, but that’s the thing.  It wasn’t.  For me, it was only five hours.  The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich? "
STEVE,"Scott, what are you talking about? "
SCOTT LANG,Time works differently in the Quantum Realm.
SCOTT LANG,"Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it.  But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another.  Like, before Thanos- "
STEVE,Wait...wait.  Scott.  Are you talking about a time machine?
SCOTT LANG,"No, not a machine.  More like a... Yeah, like a time machine.  I know it sounds crazy... "
NATASHA,"Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing’s crazy anymore. "
SCOTT LANG,"So, who do we talk to about this?"
TONY,Morgan H. Stark.  Chow time.  Want some lunch?
MORGAN STARK,Define lunch or be disintegrated.
TONY,You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom.  You thinking about lunch?
TONY,Where’d you find this?
MORGAN STARK,Garage.
TONY,You like going in the garage?  So does Daddy.  It’s all right.  Mommy never wears what I buy her.
TONY,I just want to thank you folks for dropping by.  It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape.
NATASHA,You’ve got some objections to the plan.
TONY,"So you’re calling it a plan.  To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method.  Not to mention, it’s impossible. "
SCOTT LANG,We know what it sounds like.
STEVE,"Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible? "
TONY,"Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? Chai?  In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home. "
SCOTT LANG,I did.
TONY,Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.  Now you want to pull a- What are you calling it?
SCOTT LANG,A time heist.
TONY,"Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again? "
SCOTT LANG,Still Scott...
STEVE,"Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here. "
NATASHA,We can snap our own fingers.  We can bring everybody back.
TONY,Or screw it up worse than he already has.
STEVE,I don’t believe we would.
TONY,"Gotta say it.  Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism.  Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.”  I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. "
SCOTT LANG,Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.  No talking to our past selves.  No betting on sporting events-
TONY,"Stop, Scott.  Stop.  Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future? "
SCOTT LANG,No...
TONY,"Good.  Because that would be horseshit.  Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works. "
NATASHA,We have to take a stand.
TONY,We did stand.  And yet here we are.
SCOTT LANG,"Look, Stark-  Can I call you Tony? "
TONY,Please don’t-
SCOTT LANG,Tony-
TONY,Fine.
SCOTT LANG,"I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here.  You’ve got a wife.  A daughter.  But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t even- "
TONY,"No, Scott.  I won’t.  Even."
MORGAN STARK,Mommy told me to come save you.
TONY,Good job.  I’m saved.  I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.  I’m honestly happy to see you.  If you want to stay- 
STEVE,"Tony, I get it.  And I’m happy for you.  I am.  But this is a second chance. "
TONY,"Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here.  I can’t roll the dice on it.  The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch."
NATASHA,He’s scared.
STEVE,He’s not wrong.
SCOTT LANG,What are we gonna do?  We need him. You want to stop?
STEVE,No.  I want to do it right. We’re going to need a really big brain.
SCOTT LANG,Bigger than his?
SCOTT LANG,I’m confused.
SMART HULK,These are confusing times.
SCOTT LANG,"No, that’s not what I’m- "
SMART HULK,"I’m kidding, I get it.  It’s crazy. I wear shirts now! "
SCOTT LANG,But why?
SMART HULK,"Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?"
STEVE,He’s heard.
SMART HULK,It was worse for me.  Because I lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then Banner lost.  Then we all lost.
NATASHA,"No one blamed you, Bruce. "
SMART HULK,"I did-  I feel like I’m the only one eating.  Here, try some."
SMART HULK,"Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way.  That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos. "
SCOTT LANG,Okay.  But how did...this happen?
SMART HULK,"For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure..."
SMART HULK,Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together.  And now look at me. Best of both worlds.
KID,Mr. Hulk?  Can we get a picture?
SMART HULK,"100%, little lady."
SMART HULK,"Thanks, pal.  Hulk out! "
STEVE,"So, Bruce, about what we said- "
SMART HULK,"The time travel do-over?  I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise..."
NATASHA,"You pulled this off.  I remember a time that was impossible, too. "
SMART HULK,"I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around."
TONY,"Friday, you up? "
FRIDAY,"Yes, sir. "
TONY,"I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out.  I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night.  This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted. "
FRIDAY,Processing. The model forms.
TONY,"All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp.  Run it.  That’ll take a second.  And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of... "
FRIDAY,Model rendered.
TONY,Shit.
MORGAN STARK,Shit.
TONY,What are you doing up?
MORGAN STARK,Shit.
TONY,"First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it. "
MORGAN STARK,Why are you up?
TONY,I just had something on my mind.
MORGAN STARK,Was it juice pops?
TONY,Correct.  Great minds think alike. What kind do you want?
TONY,You done? Now you are.
MORGAN STARK,Tell me a story.
TONY,"Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.  The end. "
MORGAN STARK,That was a bad story. He runs his hand over her hair.
TONY,Love you tons.
MORGAN STARK,Love you three thousand.
TONY,"Wow, that’s a lot."
TONY,Out like a light.  Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand.
PEPPER POTTS,That’s up there.
TONY,What’re you reading?
PEPPER POTTS,A book about composting-
TONY,I think I solved it.
PEPPER POTTS,Just so we’re both talking about the same thing-
TONY,Time travel.
PEPPER POTTS,That’s amazing.
TONY,Yeah.
PEPPER POTTS,And terrifying.
TONY,To say the least.
PEPPER POTTS,We got really lucky-
TONY,I know-
PEPPER POTTS,Not everybody did.
TONY,I can’t help everybody.
PEPPER POTTS,"Except, it sort of seems like you can. "
TONY,Not if I stopped right here.
PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. "
TONY,"I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed. "
PEPPER POTTS,But could you rest?
SCOTT LANG,You’re sure these modifications are safe?
SMART HULK,I reran my calculations three times-
SCOTT LANG,Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius-
SMART HULK,"I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy.  We’re good. "
SCOTT LANG,Yeah.  And you look like that on purpose.
STEVE,"Breakers are set, emergency generator’s on stand-by. "
SMART HULK,"Good.  If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s. "
SCOTT LANG,Excuse me?
NATASHA,He was kidding.
SMART HULK,I was kidding.
NATASHA,"You were kidding, right? "
SMART HULK,"Honestly, I have no idea.  We’re attempting time travel.  Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. We’re good!  Helmet on. "
SMART HULK,"Okay.  I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds.  Make sense? "
SCOTT LANG,Perfectly not confusing.
STEVE,"Good luck, Scott.  You’ve got this. "
SCOTT LANG,"Yes, I do, Captain America.  Yes, I- "
SMART HULK,"Counting down from three, two, one... "
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, guys?  This doesn’t feel right. "
NATASHA,Is that Scott?
SMART HULK,Probably...?
STEVE,Get him back!
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, my back! "
NATASHA,Bruce!  Get it under control.  What the hell is going on?
SMART HULK,"I got it, I know exactly what’s going on.  Pretty much."
NATASHA,"Oh, my God. "
STEVE,It’s a baby.
SMART HULK,It’s Scott.
STEVE,As a baby! 
SMART HULK,"When I tell you, kill the power! Now! "
SCOTT LANG,Somebody peed my pants.  I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me.
TONY,"Why the long face?  Wild guess, he turned into a baby? "
STEVE,Among other things.
TONY,"EPR Paradox.  Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang.  It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it. "
STEVE,You did.
TONY,"Thank god, I’m here.  Regardless, I fixed it. "
TONY,"That is a fully-functioning, time- space GPS.  I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive.  I hate it. "
STEVE,"Me, too."
TONY,"We’ve got a shot at the Stones.  I just need you to know my priorities.  Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully.  Keep what I found, definitely.  And, let’s not die trying."
STEVE,Sounds like a deal.
TONY,"But wait, there’s more.   Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer."
STEVE,"Tony, I don’t know- "
TONY,"What’s to know?  He made it for you.  Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
STEVE,"Thank you, Tony."
TONY,"Just don’t flaunt it.  I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right? "
STEVE,We’re trying.
ROCKET,"Hey, Humie.  Where’s Big Green? "
SCOTT LANG,"Um, kitchen, I think."
NEBULA,"Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone."
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, my God! "
RHODEY,"What’s up, Regular-Sized Man?"
ROCKET,Finally.  I ain’t got all day.
SMART HULK,I call shotgun!
ROCKET,What the heck are they looking at?
SMART HULK,I’m kind of famous...
ROCKET,"Yeah, I’m sure that’s it.  Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers... "
SMART HULK,"They lost Asgard, then half their people.  Maybe they’re just happy to have a home. "
VALKYRIE,You shouldn’t have come.
SMART HULK,"Hey, Valkyrie!  Great to see you!"
VALKYRIE,Uh huh.  I liked you better either of the other ways.
SMART HULK,This is Rocket.
ROCKET,Hey.
VALKYRIE,Hey. He won’t see you.
SMART HULK,We didn’t say we were here to see-
VALKYRIE,"Great, then you can hose out the gut buckets- "
ROCKET,We’re definitely here to see him.
VALKYRIE,He can’t give you what you need.
SMART HULK,It’s that bad?
VALKYRIE,We only see him once a month.  When he comes in for “supplies.” 
ROCKET,Something died in here.
SMART HULK,Hello...?  Thor...?
THOR,Are you here about the cable?
THOR,"Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy..."
SMART HULK,Thor?
THOR,BROS!  Bring it in!
ROCKET,"Yeah, I’m good. "
THOR,"Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right?"
KORG,Beer’s in the bucket.  Feel free to log on to the WiFi.
SMART HULK,"Hey, guys.  Long time no- "
KORG,Thor!  This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead!
THOR,Noobmaster again?
KORG,NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead-
THOR,"Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder.  This is your last warning.  Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt.  Right, who wants a drink? "
SMART HULK,"Hey, buddy, are you all right? "
THOR,Don’t I look all right?
ROCKET,You look like melted ice cream-
THOR,"So, what’s up?  Just here for a hang? "
SMART HULK,We need your help.  There’s a chance we can fix everything.
THOR,Like the cable?  It’s driving me bananas.
SMART HULK,Like Thanos.
THOR,Don’t say that name.
KORG,"Yeah, we don’t say that name in here."
SMART HULK,Please take your hand off me.
SMART HULK,"Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare you- "
THOR,"Scared?  Why would I be scared of that guy?  I’m the one who killed that guy, remember?  Anyone else here kill that guy? "
THOR,"Didn’t think so.  Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos’ head off. "
KORG,Stormbreaker?
THOR,Not.  Cool.  Man.
ROCKET,Don’t.  Care.  Dude.
SMART HULK,"Look, I get it.  You’re in a rough patch.  I’ve been there.  But you know who helped me out of it? "
THOR,Was it Natasha?
SMART HULK,It was you.  You helped me.  And I need you to help me again.
THOR,Ask the Asgardians down there how much “my help” is worth.
ROCKET,At least they’re alive-
THOR,"They were gods!  Now they’re fisherpeople!  The ones that are left, anyway. "
SMART HULK,That’s the thing.  I think we can bring them back. 
THOR,"Stop.  Stop.  I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own self- pity, waiting to be rescued.  But I’m fine.  I’m happy.  Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less. "
SMART HULK,"Come on, pal.  We need you."
ROCKET,There’s beer in the ship.
THOR,What kind?
AKIHIKO,Why are you doing this?  We never did anything to you! 
RONIN,You survived.  Half the planet didn’t.  They got Thanos.  You get me.
RONIN,You’re done hurting people.
AKIHIKO,We hurt people?  You’re crazy.
AKIHIKO,Wait!  Help me!  I’ll give you anything!  What do you want?
RONIN,What I want...you can’t give me.
CLINT BARTON,You shouldn’t be here.
NATASHA,Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON,I’ve got a job to do.
NATASHA,That what you’re calling this?
NATASHA,"Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back. We found something.  A chance, maybe... "
CLINT BARTON,Don’t.
NATASHA,Don’t what?
CLINT BARTON,Give me hope.
NATASHA,I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it sooner.
TONY,"Out of the way, Lebowski."
TONY,"Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there? "
ROCKET,"It’s Rocket, and shut up.  You’re only a genius on Earth, pal. "
TONY,And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands.
ROCKET,Fixed it.
TONY,Thank you.
ROCKET,Get used to saying that.
RHODEY,"Time travel suit, I like it."
SCOTT LANG,"Easy, easy.  Careful with those. "
SMART HULK,I’m being very careful-
SCOTT LANG,You’re being very Hulky-
SCOTT LANG,"These are Pym Particles.  You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more.  I told you.  We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs."
SCOTT LANG,Plus two test runs- 
SCOTT LANG,"One test run. Okay, maybe I’m not ready. "
CLINT BARTON,I’m game.
CLINT BARTON,I’ll do it. 
SMART HULK,"Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshift- "
RHODEY,"Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know..."
SMART HULK,"Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos.  Time doesn’t work like that.  You can’t change the future by changing the past. "
SCOTT LANG,"Sure, we can.  We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them.  Problem solved. "
NEBULA,That’s not how it works.
CLINT BARTON,I don’t know.  That is kind of what I’ve heard-
SMART HULK,Heard from who?
RHODEY,Star Trek.  Terminator.  Bill and Ted’s Excellent-
SMART HULK,"WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE.  IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE! "
NEBULA,Exactly.
RHODEY,Excuse me?
SCOTT LANG,"Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit. "
CLINT BARTON,"Look, are we doing this or not? "
SMART HULK,"Okay, Clint.  Starting in three, two, one..."
CLINT BARTON,No.  Not yet...  LILA!
LILA BARTON,Dad?
NATASHA,"Are you all right?  Hey, look at me.  You okay? "
TONY,Tell me something good...
CLINT BARTON,It worked.  It worked.
ROCKET,Holy crap.  We’re freaking time travelers.
STEVE,"Okay.  Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when."
STEVE,Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity Stones-
TONY,I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG,I haven’t. Just...saying.
SMART HULK,"Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each.  And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. "
TONY,Our history.  Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in.
CLINT BARTON,Which means we’ve got to pick our targets.
STEVE,"Exactly.  Let’s start with the Aether.  Thor, what do we know?"
NATASHA,Is he asleep?
RHODEY,I’m pretty sure he’s dead.
THOR,"The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge.  My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years."
THOR,Or...by Jane.  She stuck her hand in a rock.  Then the Aether stuck itself inside her.  Then I took her to Asgard.  We were dating... We’re not anymore.
ROCKET,Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
SMART HULK,That’s a person?
ROCKET,It’s a planet.  Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG,"Wait, like a planet...in space?"
ROCKET,"Aw, look.  It’s like a puppy, all happy and everything. "
ROCKET,"You want to go to space, puppy? I’ll take you to space."
NEBULA,Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
NATASHA,And that is...?
NEBULA,A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence.  It’s the place where Thanos murdered my sister.
SCOTT LANG,Not it.
NATASHA,So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what kind of doctor was he?
SMART HULK,Strange?
TONY,Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat.
SMART HULK,Had a nice place in the Village.
TONY,Yeah.  Sullivan Street.
SMART HULK,Bleecker.
TONY,Sullivan and Bleecker.  They’re cross streets.
NATASHA,"Wait, he lived in New York?  Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York. "
SMART HULK,Shut the front door...
STEVE,"Okay, we have a plan.  Six stones, three teams, one shot."
STEVE,"Five years ago, we lost.  All of us. "
STEVE,We lost friends.  We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. But today we have a chance to take it all back.
STEVE,"You have your teams and you have assignments.  Get your stone, and get back here.  One round trip each.  No mistakes.  No do-overs."
STEVE,"Most of us are going back to places we know.  That doesn’t mean we know what to expect.  Be careful.  Look out for each other.  Improvise, if you have to. This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. Whatever it takes."
ROCKET,He’s pretty good at that...
TONY,"All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green."
SMART HULK,Tracking beacons engaged.
ROCKET,You promise to bring that thing back in one piece?
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, sure thing.  I’ll do my best. "
ROCKET,"That’s pretty lame, as far as promises go. "
NATASHA,See you in a minute.
SMART HULK,"Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give or-"
TONY,"Okay, Park Avenue’s that way. Let’s huddle up.  Suits off."
STEVE,"We’ve all got our assignments.  Two stones uptown, one stone down. Stay low, keep an eye on time-"
STEVE,And Bruce?  Maybe smash a few things along the way.  For appearances.
SMART HULK,"All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous."
SMART HULK,Grrr...grrr... 
ANCIENT ONE,I’d be careful going that way...
ANCIENT ONE,We just had the floors waxed.
SMART HULK,Hulk...does what...Hulk want?
ANCIENT ONE,"Yes, I suppose that would be the case- "
ANCIENT ONE,Care to explain?
SMART HULK,I’m looking for Dr. Strange.
ANCIENT ONE,"You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way.  What do you want with him?"
SMART HULK,"Well, that, actually. "
ANCIENT ONE,Ah.  I’m afraid not.
SMART HULK,I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking.
ANCIENT ONE,You don’t want to do this.
SMART HULK,"You’re right, I don’t.  But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate it-"
ASTRAL BANNER,"No, no, no-"
ANCIENT ONE,"Now.  Let’s start over, shall we?"
MAIDEN,"For you, Lady Jane. "
JANE FOSTER,"Um, do you have anything with...pants? "
MAIDEN,Pants?
JANE FOSTER,It’s okay.  Nevermind.
THOR,That’s Jane.
ROCKET,"Okay, here’s the deal.  You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split."
THOR,"Um, I’ll be right back.  The wine cellar is just down here.  My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale.  Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups-"
FRIGGA,"Send Loki some soup.  I don’t think he’s eating.  And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves.  He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company."
ROCKET,Who’s the fancy broad?
THOR,My mother.  She dies today.
ROCKET,"Oh, jeez."
THOR,I can’t do this.  This is a bad idea.  I can’t do this...
ROCKET,Come here.
ROCKET,"You think you’re the only one who’s lost people?  What do you think we’re doing here?  I lost the only family I ever had.  Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone.  I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads.  I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone.  Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone.  And you can help them.  So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back? "
THOR,I guess not.
ROCKET,Good.
THOR,Thank you.  I can do this.
ROCKET,Great.
THOR,I can do this...I can do this... I can’t do this...
ROCKET,"All right, heartbreaker.  This is our shot..."
ROCKET,Thor? 
ROCKET,"I can kill him, and say the Elves did it. "
RHODEY,"That’s it, right on that line, Blue.  Keep dropping it."
CLINT BARTON,"Hey, can we hurry it up? "
NATASHA,"Yeah, come on, chop chop, we’re on the clock, here. "
RHODEY,All that?  Really helpful!
NATASHA,Take care of yourself.
RHODEY,Get that stone and come back.  No messing around.  You guys watch each other’s six.
NEBULA,Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
NATASHA,What?
CLINT BARTON,Nothing.  Just...we’re a long way from Budapest.
NATASHA,Further every second.
RHODEY,"So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? "
NEBULA,Let’s take cover.  We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones.
RHODEY,"Hey, who are you talking about right now?  Who else is looking for the stones? "
NEBULA,My father.  My sister.  And me.
RHODEY,You?  Where are you?
GAMORA,You’re welcome?
BAD NEBULA,I didn’t ask for your help.
GAMORA,And yet you always need it.  Father wants us back on the ship.
BAD NEBULA,Why?
GAMORA,He’s found an Infinity Stone.
BAD NEBULA,Where?
GAMORA,On a planet called “Morag.”
BAD NEBULA,Father’s plan is finally in motion.
GAMORA,One stone isn’t six.
BAD NEBULA,It’s a start.  If he gets them all...
GAMORA,We’ll never have to do this again.
BAD NEBULA,He’ll miss it.
THANOS,Ronan has located the Power Stone. I’m dispatching you to his ship.
GAMORA,He won’t like it.
THANOS,"His alternative is death.  Ronan’s obsession clouds his judgement. After Loki, I’m taking no chances. "
BAD NEBULA,"We will not fail you, father."
THANOS,No.  You won’t.
BAD NEBULA,I swear I will make you proud-
GAMORA,"Sister, what’s-"
RHODEY,"So, all we have to do is hang out, wait for this Quill guy, and follow him to the Power Stone, right? "
NEBULA,Let’s take cover.  We’re not the only ones in this reality looking for the stones.
GAMORA,Who was that?
BAD NEBULA,I...don’t know.  My head...splitting...
GAMORA,Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle-
THANOS,Sshhh...
THANOS,Bring her to my ship.
LOKI,If it’s all the same to you...I’ll have that drink now.
TONY,"Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass. "
STEVE,"No one asked you to look, Tony. "
SCOTT LANG,"I think you look great, Cap.  As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass. "
A1 NATASHA,Who gets the magic wand?
A1 STEVE,SHIELD’s coming up now.
TONY,"Ball’s in play.  Head’s up, Cap."
TONY,Mind Stone’s on the move.
STEVE,I’m in position.
A1 NATASHA,Careful with that.
A1 CLINT BARTON,Unless you want your mind erased. And not in the fun way.
BROCK RUMLOW,We promise to be extra careful.
SCOTT LANG,Who are these guys?
TONY,"SHIELD.  Actually, Hydra.  But we didn’t know that yet. "
SCOTT LANG,Seriously?  ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys.
TONY,You’re small but you’re talking loud.
A1 STEVE,I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.
LOKI/STEVE,"“I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.”  I mean, really, how do you keep your food down? "
A1 THOR,"Yes, that’s much better."
A1 THOR,"You coming, Stark?"
A1 TONY,"One sec, just packing my lunch. "
TONY,"All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone."
SCOTT LANG,All right.  Flick me.
A1 HULK,Hulk take stairs.
TONY,"Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just passing the 80th floor. "
STEVE,Got it.  Head to the lobby.
TONY,Already on my way.
AGENT SITWELL,"Evidence secured, we are en route to Dr. List...No, no hitches at all, Mr. Secretary..."
AGENT SITWELL,"Captain, I thought you were coordinating search and rescue? "
STEVE,Change of plans.
BROCK RUMLOW,Cap.
STEVE,Rumlow.
STEVE,I got a call from the Secretary’s office.  I’m going to be running point on the scepter.
AGENT SITWELL,Sir?  I don’t understand-
STEVE,We’ve had word there might be an attempt to steal it.
BROCK RUMLOW,"Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap. "
AGENT SITWELL,I’ll have to check with the Director-
STEVE,No.  Trust me.  It’s okay...
STEVE,Hail Hydra.
A1 HULK,SO MANY STAIRS!
TONY,"Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go."
SCOTT LANG,Bombs away.
SCOTT LANG,Is that...Axe body spray?
TONY,"Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies.  Can we focus, please? "
SCOTT LANG,I’m going inside you...
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Mind if I ask where you’re going?
A1 THOR,"We were thinking lunch, then Asgard.  And you are? "
A1 TONY,"Alexander Pierce.  He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,My friends call me Mr. Secretary.  I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me.
A1 THOR,"Loki will answer to Odin, himself. "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No, he’ll answer to us.  “Odin” can have what’s left. And we’ll need the case back, too. That’s been SHIELD property for over seventy years. "
A1 TONY,"I’m not gonna argue who has authority here but jurisdictionally speaking, we are on Stark property. That is my name on the glass... "
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Just give me the case.
TONY,"Move it, Stuart Little.  Things are getting dicey out here"
SCOTT LANG,This place is a mess. You promise you won’t die?
TONY,You’re only giving me a minor cardiac dysrhythmia-
SCOTT LANG,That doesn’t actually sound minor-
TONY,Window’s closing.  Pull my plug.
SCOTT LANG,Here goes...
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Stark?
ALEXANDER PIERCE,MEDIC!
A1 THOR,Stark?  Somebody get some help!  Is it your chest machine?
TONY,Meet me in the alley.  I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s-
SCOTT LANG,"That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it? "
A1 THOR,WHERE’S LOKI?
SECURITY,"Building-wide alert, all units. Target Loki, maximum force. "
STEVE,Tony?  What’s going on?  Tell me you got that cube-
A1 STEVE,"Strike Teams, clear Forty, then work down."
STEVE,"Oh, great. "
A1 STEVE,"Disregard.  I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor. "
STEVE,I’m not Loki.  And I don’t want to hurt you.
A1 STEVE,You’re not going to get the chance-
STEVE,Forgot about that one.
A1 STEVE,I can do this all day-
STEVE,"Yeah, I know..."
A1 STEVE,Where’d you get this?
STEVE,PX.  Camp Lehigh.  1943.
A1 STEVE,You’ve got a lot of nerve.
STEVE,That is America’s ass.
ANCIENT ONE,"I wish I could help you, Bruce..."
ANCIENT ONE,"But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own. "
ASTRAL BANNER,"Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that. "
ANCIENT ONE,"And yet, you’re the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas."
ASTRAL BANNER,"Lady, I just want to borrow your necklace- "
ANCIENT ONE,At what cost?
ANCIENT ONE,"The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time.  Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits."
ANCIENT ONE,"Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not. "
ANCIENT ONE,"In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... "
ANCIENT ONE,"For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. Now tell me, Doctor.  Can your science prevent all that? "
ASTRAL BANNER,No.  But it can erase it.
ASTRAL BANNER,"Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline.  At the moment it was taken.  So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left. "
ANCIENT ONE,"You’re leaving out the most important part, though.  In order to put the stones back, you’d have to survive. "
ASTRAL BANNER,We will.  I will.  I promise.
ANCIENT ONE,I can’t risk this reality on a promise.
ANCIENT ONE,It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone-
ASTRAL BANNER,Yeah?  Then why the hell did Strange give it away? 
ANCIENT ONE,What did you say?
ASTRAL BANNER,Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone.
ANCIENT ONE,Willingly?  Why?
ASTRAL BANNER,Don’t know.  Maybe he made a mistake.
ANCIENT ONE,Or I did.
ANCIENT ONE,Strange is meant to be the best of us.
ASTRAL BANNER,Then he must have had a reason.
ANCIENT ONE,I fear you may be right...
SMART HULK,Thank you.
ANCIENT ONE,"I’m counting on you, Bruce. We all are. "
THANOS,Run diagnostics.  Show me her memory file.
EBONY MAW,"Sir, the file appears...entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There’s another consciousness sharing her network.  Another Nebula. "
THANOS,Impossible.
EBONY MAW,This duplicate carries a time stamp...from nine years in the future.
THANOS,Where is this “other Nebula?”
EBONY MAW,In our solar system.  On Morag.
THANOS,Can you access her?
EBONY MAW,Yes.  The two are linked.
THANOS,Search the duplicate’s memory for Infinity Stones.
SMART HULK,-the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.
TONY,Our history.  Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in.
CLINT BARTON,Which means we’ve got to pick our targets.
STEVE,Exactly.  Let’s start here-
THANOS,Freeze image.
GAMORA,Terrans?
THANOS,Avengers.  Unruly wretches.
THANOS,"What’s this reflection.  Amplify this, Maw. "
GAMORA,I don’t understand.  Two Nebulas?
THANOS,No.  The same Nebula.  From two different times. Set course for Morag.  And scan the duplicate’s memories. I want to see everything...
FRIGGA,What are you doing?
THOR,Mother!  What?  Nothing.  Hello.
FRIGGA,You’re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. What are you wearing?
THOR,I always wear this.  It’s one of my favorites.
FRIGGA,And what’s wrong with your eye?
THOR,"Oh, that.  You remember the...Battle of Harokin.  I took a...broadsword to the face?"
FRIGGA,"Oh.  You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you? "
THOR,"Yes, I am- "
FRIGGA,"I was raised by witches, boy.  I see with more than eyes, you know that. I can see the future hasn’t been kind to you, has it? "
THOR,I didn’t say I was from the future...
FRIGGA,Thor...
THOR,I’m totally from the future.
FRIGGA,"Yes, you are. "
THOR,I need to talk to you.
FRIGGA,We can talk.
THOR,...and then it was done.  His head over there.  Body over there.  And me in the middle.  Just an idiot with an axe.
FRIGGA,"You’re no idiot.  You’re here, aren’t you?  Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard? "
THOR,"Yeah, I guess. "
FRIGGA,"An idiot, no.  A failure, absolutely. "
THOR,That’s a little harsh-
FRIGGA,"Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it. "
THOR,"Okay, maybe just stop talking. "
FRIGGA,And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.
THOR,"I’m not supposed to be like everyone else, though. "
FRIGGA,"Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor.  The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are."
THOR,"I’ve really missed you, Mum. "
ROCKET,I got it I got it I got it!
THOR,"Mum, I have to tell you something- "
FRIGGA,"No, son.  You don’t.  You’ve come to repair your future, not mine. "
THOR,But your future-
FRIGGA,Is none of my business.
ROCKET,"Hi.  You must be Mom. I got the thing.  Come on, we gotta move-"
THOR,I wish we had more time-
FRIGGA,"This was a gift.  Now, go be the man you’re meant to be. And eat a salad."
ROCKET,Three...two-
THOR,No.  Wait. 
ROCKET,What am I looking at?
FRIGGA,Sometimes it takes a second.
THOR,Still worthy.
THOR,"Goodbye, Mum. "
FRIGGA,"Goodbye, Son."
RHODEY,"So, he’s an idiot. "
NEBULA,Yes.
QUILL,"Oh, fu-"
RHODEY,Sorry about that.  I know you guys were teammates and everything.
NEBULA,Do you hear me complaining?
RHODEY,What is that?
NEBULA,The tool of a thief.  Come on.
RHODEY,"Hang on.  This would be about the time the spikes come out, you know, with the skeletons still on them? "
NEBULA,What are you talking about?
RHODEY,"I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually..."
RHODEY,"Traps and stuff. Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you."
RHODEY,These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix.  Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless we-
NEBULA,I wasn’t always like this.
RHODEY,"Yeah, me either.  I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh? "
RHODEY,Let’s get out of here.  Place gives me the creeps.  Sync up.  Three... two...one...
THANOS,What’s wrong?
BRUCE BANNER,You murdered trillions.
THANOS,You should be grateful.
NATASHA,Where are the stones?
THANOS,Gone.  Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER,You used them two days ago!
THANOS,I used the stones to destroy the stones.  The work is done.  It always will be...
THANOS,I AM INEVITABLE-
THANOS,I AM INEVITABLE.
GAMORA,What did you do to them?
THANOS,Nothing.  Yet.
THANOS,They’re not trying to stop something I’m going to do in our time.  They’re trying to undo something I’ve already done in theirs.
GAMORA,The stones.
THANOS,I found them all.  I won.  Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.
EBONY MAW,Sire.  This is your future?
THANOS,My destiny.
RHODEY,He’s lying.
NEBULA,My father is many things.  A liar is not one of them.
THANOS,"Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve treated you too- "
THANOS,And that is destiny fulfilled.
EBONY MAW,Sire.  Your daughter is a traitor.
BAD NEBULA,"No.  Please, father.  That’s not me.  I would never betray you. Please- "
THANOS,"Ssh, child.  I know.  And you’ll have the chance to prove it... "
NEBULA,He knows...
NEBULA,"Barton, Romanoff, come in.  We have a problem.  Thanos knows!  Thanos-"
TONY,We’ve got a problem.
STEVE,How could you lose it?
TONY,What do you want?  I got hit in the head with a Hulk!
SCOTT LANG,You said we only had one shot. This was our shot.  We shot it.  It was six stones or nothing!  Six stones-
TONY,You’re not helping-
SCOTT LANG,You ruined the Time Heist!
TONY,"Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there.  Knows the restaurants.  It’s a safe bet he visits home.  If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can fly- "
STEVE,Loki could be anywhere in the universe.  We’d be old men before we found him.
STEVE,What other options did we have on the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG,"Whoa, whoa.  We don’t have any other options.  We can’t go to any other times.  No do-overs!  We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home. "
STEVE,"But if we don’t try, nobody else comes home, either. "
TONY,"I got it!  There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. Military installation, Garden State."
STEVE,When were they both there?
TONY,I have a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE,How vague?
SCOTT LANG,"Hang on, what’s in New Jersey? "
TONY,"I know they were there, and I know how I know. "
STEVE,Looks like we’re improvising.
SCOTT LANG,Wait!  What are you improvising?
STEVE,"Scott, take this back to the Compound. "
TONY,"All right, suits on.  Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70... "
SCOTT LANG,"Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back."
TONY,You trust me?
STEVE,I do.
STAN LEE,"Make love, not war, baby!"
TONY,"You weren’t actually born here, right?"
STEVE,The idea of me was.
TONY,"All right.  If I was SHIELD and I wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic black site, where would I hide it? "
STEVE,In plain sight.
TONY,"Good luck with that mission, Captain. "
STEVE,"Good luck with your project, Doctor."
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,You new here?
STEVE,Not exactly.
TONY,"Come on, you little hexahedron, where are you hiding?"
TONY,"You may not know it now, but someday you’re going to be a real pain-in-the-ass."
HOWARD STARK,"Hey, Arnim, you in here?"
HOWARD STARK,"Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola.  You seen him? "
TONY,No.  Haven’t seen a soul.
HOWARD STARK,I know you?
TONY,"No, sir.  Just visiting from MIT. "
HOWARD STARK,That so?  Got a name?
TONY,Howard...
HOWARD STARK,Easy to remember-
TONY,Potts.
HOWARD STARK,"I’m Howard Stark. You seem a little green around the gills, Potts.  Need some air? "
TONY,That’d be swell.
HOWARD STARK,Need the briefcase?
HANK PYM,Hello?
STEVE,Dr. Pym?
HANK PYM,"That would be the number you called, yes."
STEVE,"This is Captain Stevens, from shipping.  We have a package for you."
HANK PYM,So bring it up.
STEVE,"That’s the thing, sir, we can’t."
HANK PYM,Maybe I’m confused.  Isn’t that your job?
STEVE,"It’s just...sir, the box is glowing.  And to be honest, a couple of our mail guys aren’t feeling great- "
HANK PYM,"They didn’t open it, did they?!"
TONY,Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big night planned?
HOWARD STARK,My wife’s expecting.  And too much time at the office.
TONY,Congratulations.
HOWARD STARK,Thanks.
TONY,How far along is she?
HOWARD STARK,"Gee, I suppose... ...this far.  She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing.  So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again. "
TONY,I have a little girl.
HOWARD STARK,A girl would be nice.  Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me.
TONY,Would that be so bad?
HOWARD STARK,Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest.
M.P.,You’ve never seen either of these men before?
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,No.  But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy.
M.P.,Describe ‘fishy’.
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,One of them had a hippie beard.
M.P.,We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
FEMALE SHIELD AGENT,Definitely Mungo Jerry.
M.P.,This is Chesler.  We need every available agent to sub-level 6.  We have a potential breach.
PEGGY CARTER,"So, send them in. "
MALE AGENT,"They’re trying, ma’am, but Braddock’s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. "
PEGGY CARTER,"Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections.  You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place.  Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain. "
MALE AGENT,"Yes, ma’am."
PEGGY CARTER,Here we are...
PEGGY CARTER,"Crikey O’Reilly.  Sergeant?  Hang up and call Air Command.  Braddock needs back up, immediately. "
MALE AGENT,Ma’am?
PEGGY CARTER,Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at...
TONY,"Got any names, yet? "
HOWARD STARK,"If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. "
TONY,You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time.
HOWARD STARK,"What are you, couple years older than me? "
TONY,Yeah.  I guess.
HOWARD STARK,Let me ask you a question.  When your kid was born...were you nervous?
TONY,Wildly.
HOWARD STARK,Did you feel qualified?  Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?
TONY,I pieced it together as I went along.  I thought about what my dad did...
HOWARD STARK,My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt.
TONY,"I tried to hold onto the good stuff.  Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there. "
HOWARD STARK,Like what?
TONY,“No amount of money ever bought a second of time.”
HOWARD STARK,That’s good.  Smart guy.
TONY,He did his best.
HOWARD STARK,"I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him."
HOWARD STARK,"Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack.  Isn’t that right? "
EDWIN JARVIS,"Indeed, sir.  I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo."
HOWARD STARK,"Well, good to meet you, Potts. "
TONY,"You’re going to do fine, Howard. "
HOWARD STARK,Thanks.  See you around?
TONY,Count on it...
HOWARD STARK,Have we met him before?
EDWIN JARVIS,"We’ve met a lot of people, sir. "
HOWARD STARK,Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
BAD NEBULA,You’re weak.
NEBULA,I’m you-
BAD NEBULA,Shut up!
NEBULA,You could stop this.  You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future?  Thanos finds the Soul Stone.
NEBULA,You want to know how he does that? You want to know what he does to you-
BAD NEBULA,ENOUGH!
BAD NEBULA,You disgust me...but that doesn’t mean you’re useless.
BAD NEBULA,How do I look?
CLINT BARTON,"Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome."
CLINT BARTON,Really starting to regret my choice here.
NATASHA,Yeah.  I’m gonna bet the raccoon didn’t have to climb a mountain.
CLINT BARTON,I don’t think technically he’s a raccoon...
NATASHA,Whatever.  He eats garbage-
HOODED FIGURE,"I assure you, you have nothing to fear from me. "
CLINT BARTON,Creepy.
HOODED FIGURE,"Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith. "
CLINT BARTON,Creepier.
NATASHA,Who are you?
RED SKULL,"Consider me a guide.  To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone. "
NATASHA,"Great.  You show us where it is, and we’ll be on our way."
RED SKULL,"Oh, liebchen.  If only it were that easy..."
RED SKULL,What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear.
NATASHA,The Stone is down there?
RED SKULL,"For one of you.  For the other... The Stone demands a sacrifice.  In order to take it, you must leave behind that which you love. "
RED SKULL,A soul for a soul. 
CLINT BARTON,Maybe he’s full of shit.
NATASHA,I don’t think so.
CLINT BARTON,"Why, because he knew your daddy’s name? "
NATASHA,"I didn’t. Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter.  You really think that’s a coincidence?"
NATASHA,Whatever it takes...
CLINT BARTON,Whatever it takes...
NATASHA,"If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. "
CLINT BARTON,Then I guess we both know who it has to be.
NATASHA,Yeah.  Guess we do.
CLINT BARTON,I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person.
NATASHA,"For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here.  This is all it’s been about.  Bringing everybody back. "
CLINT BARTON,Do not get all decent on me-
NATASHA,"You think I want to do it?  I’m trying to save your life, you idiot- "
CLINT BARTON,And I don’t want you to. Nat.  You know what I’ve done. What I am now.  Your life’s worth ten of mine-
NATASHA,I don’t judge people by their worst mistakes-
CLINT BARTON,Maybe you should-
NATASHA,You didn’t.
CLINT BARTON,"You’re a pain in my ass, you know that?"
CLINT BARTON,Tell my family I love them.
NATASHA,Tell them yourself.
CLINT BARTON,Damn you.
NATASHA,Let me go.
CLINT BARTON,No.  Please no...
NATASHA,It’s okay...
CLINT BARTON,"Natasha, no-"
RHODEY,Are you telling me that actually worked?
SMART HULK,Did we get them all?
STEVE,Clint?  Are you okay?
SMART HULK,Where’s Nat? WHERE’S NAT?! 
TONY,Do we know if she had family?
STEVE,Yeah.  Us.
THOR,Why are you doing that?
TONY,I’m just asking a question-
THOR,"Why are we talking as if she’s dead?  We have the stones.  Bring her back.  C’mon, stop this shit."
CLINT BARTON,We can’t get her back.
THOR,"What’s he talking about?  Of course, we can. "
CLINT BARTON,It can’t be undone.  That’s why.
THOR,"No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being.  We’re talking about space magic, here.  “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think? "
CLINT BARTON,"Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she? "
THOR,That’s my point-
CLINT BARTON,"It can’t be undone.  At least that’s what the red, floating guy said.  But why don’t you go talk to him, okay?  Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. It was supposed to be me.  She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.  She bet her life on it."
SMART HULK,She’s not coming back.  We have to make it worth it.  We have to.
STEVE,We will.
ROCKET,"All right.  The glove’s ready. Question is, who’s gonna snap their freaking fingers?"
THOR,I’ll do it.
TONY,"Whoa, whoa, what are you doing- "
STEVE,"Thor, we haven’t decided who’s putting that on. "
THOR,Oh.  Were all of you just waiting for the right opportunity?
ROCKET,Maybe I was getting around to it-
SCOTT LANG,We should at least discuss it-
THOR,"Staring at the thing isn’t going to bring everybody back, is it?  Look, I’m the strongest Avenger.  It’s my responsibility.  Fate wills it so. "
TONY,"Hold on, hold on- "
THOR,Stop it!  Let me do this.  Let me do something good.  Something right-
TONY,That thing is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. You’re in no condition-
THOR,What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
RHODEY,Cheez Whiz?
THOR,Lightning.
SMART HULK,"Lightning won’t help you, pal. It’s gotta be me. You saw what those stones did to Thanos.  They almost killed him. None of you could survive. "
STEVE,And how do we know you can?
SMART HULK,We don’t.  But the radiation’s mostly gamma. It’s like I was made for this...
TONY,Good to go?
SMART HULK,Let’s do it.
TONY,"Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago, you’re just bringing them back...to today. Don’t change anything from the last five years.  Got it? "
SMART HULK,Got it.
TONY,"Friday, why don’t you go ahead and activate Barn Door Protocol? "
SMART HULK,Everybody’s coming home...
THOR,"What’s happening?  Take it off, take if off! "
STEVE,"Bruce, you okay? "
TONY,"Talk to me, Banner. "
SMART HULK,I’m...okay...
STEVE,Bruce!
TONY,Don’t move him!
SMART HULK,Did it work?
CLINT BARTON,Honey?
SCOTT LANG,"Guys, I think it-"
THANOS,Daughter?
BAD NEBULA,"Yes, father..."
THANOS,So this is the future.  Well done.
BAD NEBULA,"Thank you, Father.  They suspected nothing. "
THANOS,The arrogant never do.
THANOS,Go.  Find the stones.  Bring them to me.
BAD NEBULA,What will you do?
THANOS,Wait.
RHODEY,Canopy!  Canopy!
RHODEY,Mayday!  Tony.  Cap.  Does anybody hear me?!
RHODEY,Hang on!
RHODEY,Mayday!  Mayday!  We are taking on water!
RHODEY,...anyone...Mayday...Mayday-
SCOTT LANG,"Wait, what...? "
ROCKET,Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses up-
RHODEY,...trapped...drowning...no time...
SCOTT LANG,"No!  Wait, I’m here!"
CLINT BARTON,Cap?  Stark?  Anyone?
TONY,"You lose this again, I’m keeping it. "
STEVE,What happened?
TONY,Told you.  We messed with time. Time messed back.
STEVE,Where are the others?
TONY,"I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell."
TONY,What’s he been doing?
THOR,Absolutely nothing.
STEVE,Son of a bitch.
TONY,Yeah.
STEVE,Where are the stones?
TONY,Somewhere under all of this.  All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.
STEVE,So we keep it that way.
THOR,You know it’s a trap.
TONY,Don’t think I care.
THOR,Just so we’re all in agreement.
THOR,Let’s kill him properly this time.
THANOS,You could not live with your own failure.  And where did that bring you?  Right back to me.
THANOS,"I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails.  As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be.  They will resist. "
TONY,Yep.  We’re all kinds of stubborn.
THANOS,I’m thankful.  Because now I know what I must do.
THANOS,I will shred this universe down to its last atom.
THANOS,"And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given.  A grateful universe. "
STEVE,Born out of blood.
THANOS,They’ll never know it.
THANOS,Because you won’t be alive to tell them.
NEBULA,What do you want?
GAMORA,In the future...what happens to you and me?
NEBULA,"I try to kill you.  Several times. But, eventually...we become friends.  We become sisters. "
GAMORA,That’s hard to believe.
NEBULA,A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe.
GAMORA,Come on.  We can still stop him.
SMART HULK,Rhodey.  Rocket.  Get out of here. Save yourselves.
ROCKET,No good.  Couldn’t even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through.
SMART HULK,AAARRRGH!
RHODEY,MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!
SCOTT LANG,HANG ON!  I’M COMING!
CLINT BARTON,"Oh, hey.  I know you."
BAD NEBULA,Father.  I have the stones.
CLINT BARTON,What- 
GAMORA,Stop.
BAD NEBULA,You’re betraying us?
GAMORA,Not you.
NEBULA,You don’t have to do this.
BAD NEBULA,I am this.
GAMORA,No.  You’re not.
NEBULA,You’ve seen what we become-
GAMORA,"Sister, listen to her- "
BAD NEBULA,Shut up.  You’re a traitor!
NEBULA,You can change.
BAD NEBULA,He won’t let me.
CLINT BARTON,I’m not even gonna ask.
FRIDAY,Boss?  Wake up!
RHODEY,"See you on the other side, man."
THOR,I...knew...it...
THANOS,In all my years of conquest...
THANOS,Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal.
THANOS,"But I’ll tell you now, the things I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet... "
THANOS,"I’m going to enjoy it.  Very, very much."
MUFFLED VOICE,-ap-...-comin-...-ot-
SAM WILSON,Cap.  On your left.
DR. STRANGE,Is that everyone?
WONG,You wanted more?!
SCOTT LANG,"Top floor, everybody out! "
STEVE,Avengers...assemble.
THOR,No.  You take the little one.
PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark.  Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on.  Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty?  I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.”  And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he does-"
PETER PARKER,Oh.  This is nice.
QUILL,Gamora?
QUILL,I thought I lost you.
QUILL,You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time.
GAMORA,This is the one?  Seriously?
NEBULA,Your choices were him or a tree.
CLINT BARTON,What do you want to do with this thing?
STEVE,Get those stones as far away as possible!
SMART HULK,No!  We need to send them back where they came from.
TONY,There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine.
SCOTT LANG,Hold on! That wasn’t our only time machine.
STEVE,"Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there? "
VALKYRIE,Yeah.  But you’re not going to like where it’s parked.
TONY,"Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working? "
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, maybe ten minutes. "
STEVE,Get it started.  We’ll get the stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE,"We’re on it, Cap."
TONY,Doc.  You said we win one in 14 million.  Is this how it goes down?
DR. STRANGE,"If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen. "
TONY,You better be right.
EBONY MAW,"Sire, the stones! "
T’CHALLA,"Clint, give it to me."
SCOTT LANG,Ignition’s broken.  I’ll hotwire it-
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Wait, you know how to do that?"
SCOTT LANG,I was in prison.  I know how to do a lot of things.
WANDA,You took everything from me.
THANOS,I don’t even know who you are.
WANDA,You will.
PETER PARKER,I GOT IT!
PETER PARKER,Activate instant kill!
THANOS,Rain fire.  Wipe them all out.
CORVUS GLAIVE,"But, sire, our troops- "
THANOS,Just do it!
PEPPER POTTS,"Um, is anyone else seeing this?"
PETER PARKER,I got this...I got this...I don’t got this.
STEVE,"Hey, Queens!  Heads up! "
PEPPER POTTS,"Hang on, kid.  I’ve got you."
PETER PARKER,"Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!"
ROCKET,At least we’re going out together this time...
SAM WILSON,What the hell is this?
TONY,"Friday, what are they firing at? "
FRIDAY,Something just entered the upper atmosphere.
GROOT,I am Groot.
ROCKET,Just wait for it.
ROCKET,"Oh, yeah! "
STEVE,Danvers!  We’re gonna need an assist down here!
CAROL DANVERS,Roger...Rogers...
SCOTT LANG,I’m almost there.  Where’s the glove?
PETER PARKER,"Uh, hey.  I’m Peter Parker. "
CAROL DANVERS,"Hey, Peter Parker.  You got something for me?"
PETER PARKER,I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all that-
WANDA,"Don’t worry, kid..."
OKOYE,She’s got help.
SCOTT LANG,Thirty seconds!
THANOS,I am...inevitable.
TONY,And I...am Iron Man.
QUILL,Babe?  Gamora?
PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won.  You did it, sir..."
PEPPER POTTS,"Hey, Friday, what’ve we got? "
FRIDAY,Life functions critical.
PEPPER POTTS,"Tony, look at me.  We’re going to be okay..."
PEPPER POTTS,You can rest now.
TONY,Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way.  Maybe this time.
TONY,"I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration. "
TONY,"I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.  If there ever was such a thing."
TONY,"God, what a world.  Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised.  But come on..."
TONY,"Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in."
TONY,"That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part. "
TONY,"I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all.  But that’s the hero gig, right?  Part of the journey is the end."
TONY,What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to.
TONY,I love you 3000.
CLINT BARTON,I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it.
WANDA,She knows.  They both do.
HAPPY HOGAN,"How are you doing, squirt?  You hungry? "
MORGAN STARK,"Uh, huh. "
HAPPY HOGAN,What do you want?
MORGAN STARK,Cheeseburgers?
HAPPY HOGAN,Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers?
MORGAN STARK,"No, I didn’t know that. "
HAPPY HOGAN,I’m going to get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
VALKYRIE,So when can we expect you back?
THOR,About that...
VALKYRIE,"Thor, your people need a king. "
THOR,They already have one.  And she’s a far better king than I could ever be.
VALKYRIE,Are you serious?
THOR,"It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be.  And a leader is who you are."
VALKYRIE,"You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here. "
THOR,"I’m counting on it, Your Majesty."
VALKYRIE,What will you do?
THOR,"I’m not entirely sure.  For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. But I do have a ride."
ROCKET,"Move it or lose it, Hairbag."
THOR,"Home sweet home.  Tree!  Good to see you.  The Asgardians of the Galaxy, together again."
THOR,"All right, where first?"
QUILL,"You know, I’m still in charge, here, right? "
THOR,Of course.  Of course...
QUILL,"See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-” "
THOR,"Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up. "
DRAX,You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
NEBULA,Sounds fair.
QUILL,That’s not necessary...
ROCKET,I’ve got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives.
MANTIS,"Oh, yes, please, use knives- "
QUILL,No one’s using knives!
GROOT,I am Groot!
THOR,There’ll be no knifing young Quail today.  Everyone knows who’s in charge.
QUILL,Me. Right?
SMART HULK,"Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken.  Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities. "
STEVE,Got it.  I’ll clip all the branches.
SMART HULK,"You know, I tried.  When I had the gauntlet.  I really tried to bring her back. I miss her. "
STEVE,"Me, too. "
SMART HULK,You’d better get going.  We’re almost ready for you.
SAM WILSON,"You look a little nervous going by yourself.  Ask nicely, I’ll go with you. "
STEVE,"You’re a good man, Sam.  But this one’s on me."
STEVE,"Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay? "
BUCKY BARNES,How can I?  You’re taking all the stupid with you.
BUCKY BARNES,"Gonna miss you, buddy. "
STEVE,"It’s going to be okay, Buck."
SAM WILSON,How long’s this gonna take?
SMART HULK,"For him, as long as he needs.  For us, five seconds. Ready, Cap?  You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay?"
STEVE,You bet.
SMART HULK,"Going Quantum in three, two, one. "
SMART HULK,"Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...one-"
SAM WILSON,Where is he?
SMART HULK,I don’t know.  He blew past our time stamp.  He should be here.
SAM WILSON,Get him back!
SMART HULK,I’m trying.
SAM WILSON,Get him the hell back-
SMART HULK,I’M TRYING!
BUCKY BARNES,Sam.
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap."
OLD STEVE,"Hi, Sam. "
SAM WILSON,Something go wrong...or something go right?
OLD STEVE,"I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get. "
SAM WILSON,How was it?
OLD STEVE,It was beautiful.
SAM WILSON,I’m happy for you.  Really.
OLD STEVE,Thanks.
SAM WILSON,Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America.
OLD STEVE,That’s kind of why I’m here.
SAM WILSON,Where did you even get this?
OLD STEVE,I had a little time to travel. Try it on.
OLD STEVE,How does it feel?
SAM WILSON,Like it’s someone else’s.
OLD STEVE,It isn’t.
SAM WILSON,Thank you.  I’ll try my best.
OLD STEVE,That’s why it’s yours.
SAM WILSON,You gonna tell me about her?
OLD STEVE,Nope.  I don’t think I will.
