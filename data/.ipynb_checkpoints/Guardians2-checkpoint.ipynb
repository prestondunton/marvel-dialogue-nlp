Yondu didn’t have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow. And he didn’t have the voice of an angel, but he did have the whistle of one.

So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff kinda did end up being my Dad after all, only he was Yondu.  I had a pretty cool Dad. Quill starts to break down.   \n",
