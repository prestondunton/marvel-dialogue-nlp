It’s a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn’t find any. That’s when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.  \n",
