He walks over to it and stares. Two guards outside are shot down with arrows while securing the building. The quinjet is speeding across the cloudy skies, making its way to Germany. Barton and some men rush over to a door with a scanner on the side. They prepare to break in. Loki walks down some stairs from a balcony. GALA SCIENTIST is at a podium talking. Loki hits a man with his scepter, knocking him to the floor. The guests stop and stare in awe. Loki swiftly grabs the GALA SCIENTIST -- flips him onto a statue and then uses a device to bore into his eye. The guests scatter in horror, screaming, running away as Loki smiles menacingly. The image of the eye is transported to a similar device Barton is holding over a retina scanner. The door opens. Barton runs in and steals takes a glass tube containing the Iridium. People flee the gala, screaming, and Loki follows, taking on his Asgardian attire. He blasts a Polizei (police) car speeding toward him, flipping it over. He creates duplicates of himself, surrounding a mob of gala people.</td>\n",

The Chitauri fire at the restaurant. WAITRESS and her co-workers are left outside, they duck and take cover from the shots. When they get the chance, they take off inside the cafe. WAITRESS, her co-workers, and customers look out the window at the destruction that the aliens cause. Loki walks out on the pad, his Asgardian armor materializing as he looks out over the chaos below. Suddenly, Thor lands lower on the platform.</td>\n",

Loki fires a beam from his spear, flipping the car over on its head -- blocking the pursuing vehicles and fleeing cars. The portal begins to collapse as Fury tries to escape. Falling debris misses him by a few inches. Coulson is assisting evacuation, supervising guards as the wheel crates. An explosion rocks the building. They all fall as the roof dissolves faster.

She fires back, finally Barton gets the upper hand and swings in front of Hill -- cutting her off. She turns he jeep around and continues to speed behind them. Fury’s chopper is in the air, the ground begins collapsing. The Tesseract portal cloud explodes. The entire base explodes and crumbles in on itself -- sinking into the underground. Fury watches in horror from his chopper window. The ceiling of the tunnel falls, trapping Hill and other agents underground. Loki looks at the exit to see if they will make it out. Coulson and the others in the canopy stare at the ground behind their truck -- the ground is still collapsing, seconds behind there vehicle, they get away in time. Loki and the others escape the tunnel seconds before the exit is covered up by the fallen ceiling. As they drive along, Fury’s chopper chases them.

Luchkov moves in for the cell phone. Natasha kicks him between the legs and headbutts him. WEASELLY THUG swings his fist at her and she kicks him back. TALL THUG runs up and she spins around -- and the chair legs hit him. WEASELLY THUG jumps to his feet. Natasha rolls with the chair and drops the legs on his feet. She whips her head at him and hits him in the nose then trips him. As she fights the TALL THUG, Coulson listens to the fight over the phone. He stands quiet -- waiting as he hears the groaning, kicking, and punching. Natasha spring boards off TALL THUG’s back, somersaults, and breaks the chair on WEASELLY THUG. TALL THUG grabs her and Natasha bends his hand then hits him with the chair leg. She does a front dropkick against TALL THUG then pushes herself off the ground with both hands. She runs toward TALL THUG, who is out of breath, and flips him with her thighs. Luchkov stands and she swiftly walks over to the chain hanging from the ceiling. As he approaches she hits him with it, wraps one leg in it, and throws him into the pit. She leaves him upside down and picks up the cell and her high heels.   \n",

If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. Loki comes back and he flinches. He stares, mad. A jet flies to a giant carrier in the water, it’s the SHIELD HELICARRIER in all its glory. Personnel are walking all over, some are strapping down jets and containers. A jet lands. Coulson and Steve step out of it. Natasha walks toward them.   \n",

Propellers begin to spin and the carrier begins to lift into the air. Oh no, this is much worse. The helicarrier begins ascending higher and higher. Rogers and Banner follow Natasha into the bridge. Natasha peels away from them as they stare and observe in awe. It’s very busy, with SHIELD personnel working at stations, and communicating over earpieces.   \n",

Steve nods and walks off. A busy street. Cars pull up and drop off fancy guests. String quartet No. 13 is playing in a large ballroom filled with people talking, mingling. Steve walks through a door and in a case is the new and improved CAPTAIN AMERICA suit. He walks over to it and stares. Two guards outside are shot down with arrows while securing the building. The quinjet is speeding across the cloudy skies, making its way to Germany. Barton and some men rush over to a door with a scanner on the side. They prepare to break in. Loki walks down some stairs from a balcony. GALA SCIENTIST is at a podium talking. Loki hits a man with his scepter, knocking him to the floor. The guests stop and stare in awe. Loki swiftly grabs the GALA SCIENTIST -- flips him onto a statue and then uses a device to bore into his eye. The guests scatter in horror, screaming, running away as Loki smiles menacingly. The image of the eye is transported to a similar device Barton is holding over a retina scanner. The door opens. Barton runs in and steals takes a glass tube containing the Iridium. People flee the gala, screaming, and Loki follows, taking on his Asgardian attire. He blasts a Polizei (police) car speeding toward him, flipping it over. He creates duplicates of himself, surrounding a mob of gala people.   \n",

I said- KNEEL! The people hurry, dropping to their knees. (walking through the mob) Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel. A German old man gets to his feet.   \n",

Loki looks to the sky. There’s a crash on top of the quinjet. Something as landed. Tony, Steve, and Natasha look up. SHOCKED and JOLTED. There seems to be a shadowy figure holding onto the quinjet. We make it out -- this is THOR ODINSON, God of Thunder. He is serious. There’s another flash of light. Natasha speeds up. Steve runs for something, he grabs his cowl while Tony grabs his helmet which attaches itself to the suit. Tony pushes a button and opens the ramp of the jet.   \n",

Loki smirks from the cliff top as Thor summons Mjolnir then swings it in circles. Iron Man gets to his feet and fires a repulse blast at Thor, then flies at him, kicking him through a tree. Thor stands, summoning a bolt of lightning as Loki watches in the distance. Thor sends the bolt at Iron Man.   \n",

Iron Man fires at Thor. The two stand ready then fly at each other, smashing through the trees and scraping up a cliff side. Trees are toppled as they crash to the forest grounds. Thor and Iron Man stand quickly. Thor sends in a left hook so Iron Man is about to punch but Thor grabs his fist. Iron Man is about to send in his left hook and Thor grabs that too. Thor begins to crush Iron Man’s right gauntlet with ease. Tony looks at the HUD which is alerting him. He groans and thinks. Iron Man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires a blast at Thor’s face -- it does nothing to Thor so he head butts him. Thor headbutts him back. Iron Man flies back, coming to a stop before launching himself at Thor. Iron Man throws Thor into a broken tree. Thor then stands and the two go at it for a bit longer -- a fist fight. Thor summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of Tony but Iron Man ditches, causing Thor to fall. Behind the rising Thor, Iron Man swoops in and punches him. They get ready to sends blows at each other until Cap’s shield ricochets off both their chest.   \n",

No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing. Thor gives Tony a look as he walks to the control panels.   \n",

So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

The transformation completes and Banner’s alter ego, the Hulk, gets unsteadily to his feet, and roars. Romanoff wrenches her foot free and stands looking -- and the Hulk turns to look at her. She turns and runs up the catwalk stairs as the Hulk chases her. She swings over a catwalk, and rolls under a turbine, as the Hulk tears down the stairs. Natasha jumps through small places as the Hulk grabs after her, roaring loudly. She crawls away under pipes. In the cell, Loki hears the Hulk roaring and smiles. Fury enters, running, yelling.   \n",

The place is dark. Natasha sneaks under an engine. She is hiding from the Hulk. She hears the footsteps. She pulls her gun, holding it ready and she moves out from the pips and walks. Suddenly, the Hulk jumps at her, roaring. Romanoff fires her gun at a pipe over his head and gas shoots out. She runs along a narrow passage, the Hulk crashing through behind her. He comes up on her fast. In slo-mo he catches up to her as she is about to run off the passage -- he back hands her against a wall. He steps towards her. Natasha is groaning, unable to move, scared. He raises a fist, about to strike, when he is tackled through a wall by Thor. They are in the... The two roll into a docking area with planes and personnel run from the room. The two circle one another, as Natasha takes the attack in -- then the Hulk strikes, throwing wild punches as Thor ducks and weaves. Hulk brings down a fist and Thor holds it above him, on his knees.   \n",

Rogers makes his way over to the lever. Thor flies in some stacked containers. He slides across the floor on one knee and one leg out. He wipes a little blood from his nose. The Hulk roars and Thor looks up, grinning, and raises his hand. Mjolnir comes flying through the docking area and Thor catches it just as the Hulk charges through and hits him on the jaw -- sending him into a plane. Hulk get up and rips the wing off the plane, flinging it at Thor, who ducks, causing the wing to hit a jeep. Thor throws Mjolnir. The Hulk catches the hammer but is pulled backwards. He tries to lift the hammer but cannot. Thor picks it up and wraps his arms around the Hulk’s neck. Hulks tries swinging Thor off. Fury is at the controls and Hill is walking across the room.   \n",

Hulk lands on the nose of the jet and tears at the metal as it swerves in the air. The pilot tries to eject himself but the Hulk grabs him and throws him off to the side. The pilot’s parachute opens and the plane explodes, sending Hulk plummeting to the earth. Iron Man saws off pieces of debris with a laser. He jumps on them, knocking them off the rotors. A pair of Loki’s men engage, one throws a grenade. Cap jumps into the air and slaps it away. He land back on the carrier and fights them off, standing close to the lever. He ends up throwing one of the men off the carrier. Cap jumps onto a catwalk, picks up a machine gun, and begins firing at the last man. Fury is still shooting at the enemies.   \n",

Iron Man flies in between the rotors and begins to push, slowly picking up speed as sparks fly. Cap is forced over the edge by a gunman and falls -- almost dropping off the carrier, hanging on by a wire. Thor runs into the room where Loki’s contained. He sees the door slide up and runs over to Loki, only to go straight through him. Loki reappears behind him and closes the door, locking Thor inside.   \n",

Barton is walking along a passage catwalk. Natasha appears behind him and he quickly turns and shoots a bow, which flies by her. She pushes his hand. He charges her and she kicks him, then rolls underneath some pipes -- popping up on the other side of the catwalk, kicking him in the knee. He shoots another arrow, which she dodges by dropping across to the next passage. Barton follows her. They fight along that catwalk. The fight is very even. Barton tries hitting her with the bow and she pulls on the string. They fight some more, headbutting and punching. They both pull daggers. Thor his the cage with his hammer, the cage cracks but it begins to shake off the bolts and shudders.   \n",

Barton grabs Natasha’s hair and pulls, exposing her neck to his dagger. Romanoff sinks her teeth into his arm and he lets go, trying to force her down when she spins, throwing Barton into the railing. He falls to the ground, groaning, then looks up.   \n",

She sends him a left hook. The cell is still dropping, flipping all over the place. Thor trying desperately to break free from the cell, swinging Mjolnir at the glass sides as he plummets, twisting and turning, through the air. He braces himself against a wall and launches across the space, crashing through the glass and just before the cell slams into the ground. Thor crashes into a field like a meteorite. Coulson is slumped on the floor and Loki turns to leave.   \n",

Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury scatters them on the table. Some are wet with blood. We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming. Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and Tony. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Tony stands and walks out. Well, it’s an old fashioned notion. Thor is making his way over to Mjolnir. He hesitates to pick it up, fearing he is not worthy. He clenches his fist. Banner wakes, naked, in a pile of rubble. There is a SECURITY GUARD standing over him.   \n",

A) In the field, Thor lifts Mjolnir to the skies. B) Cap straps his shield onto his back. C) Barton puts on his quiver. D) Natasha powers up her Widow’s Bite. Her bracelets light up. E) Tony is in a workshop making repairs to his helmet. Agents walk by in the background. The helmet lights up. F) Thor summons a bolt of lightening. The field grows dark, with clouds. His armor slowly begins to fly on. G) Barton and Natasha walk side-by-side behind Captain America, who is leading them through the lower hangar bay. They’re all ready to kick butt.

Army. Iron Man speeds towards the incoming army, shooting at them. The Chitauri fire back at him. He fires more blasts, spinning out the way, dodging the exploding debris. Iron Man continues flying higher. BAM! He is hit by a Chitauri hovercraft. He rights himself and releases mini-missiles at the Chitauri, blowing them up. The citizens get out of their taxis and vehicles, looking to the sky. They run for their lives as the Chitauri come toward them -- blowing up cars, buildings, and the streets. The Chitauri fire at the restaurant. WAITRESS and her co-workers are left outside, they duck and take cover from the shots. When they get the chance, they take off inside the cafe.

Swing that park, I’m gonna lay ’em out for you. Iron Man flies fast, leading a troop of Chitauri, past Stark Tower -- where Thor and Loki are still fight each other. He flies around the building, takes a sharp turn -- causing some of the troop to crash. Barton and Natasha are piloting the plane. They release the canon gun. Iron Man flies past them at high-speed and they release continuous fire at the troop of Chitauri in front of them. They fly through the smoke and up to Stark Tower.   \n",

Let’s keep them occupied. The quinjet comes around a building, blasting the army who are firing at them. One of the wings are grazed by Chitauri gunfire. They slow as the come to.... Thor smashes Loki’s head into a glass on the catwalk of Stark Tower. They still fight.   \n",

Loki spots the jet. He throws Thor to the floor, then blasts one of the jet’s rotor blades with his scepter -- it catches fire. Thor sees, angry, charges Loki and tackles him as the quinjet falls to the ground. Loki and Thor throw punches. Natasha and Barton hold on for their dear lives. Cap grabs a hold of the roof as the plane grazes buildings and crashes to the street. Natasha and Barton remove their headsets, open the ramp, and Cap and them exit the jet.   \n",

CUTAWAY TO STREETS: Loki and his following troop blowing up the streets. A JAPANESE FAMILY runs away as they are almost shot. A flying craft flies through a Dr. Pepper truck. Loki and the troop come to a busy street -- the one where the YOUNG COP and POLICE SERGEANT are at -- and blow up cars. The police and civilians run for their lives. They’re fish in a barrel down there. Natasha stands and fires both her guns at an incoming group of Chitauri.   \n",

Barton grabs a arrow and shoots it, hitting one alien in the head, the arrow quickly separates into more arrows, killing three Chitauri aliens. Cap leaves the other two fighting and jumps off an overpass, rolling onto a bus and into the street. Barton helps people off a bus as Natasha shoots her pistols at Chitauri. He runs over to Natasha and begins releasing arrows as she shoots.   \n",

       "889   ...yay! Stark flies off and the Leviathan follows him. Barton and Natasha are fighting warrior up close. Barton trips one with his bow. He pulls an arrow and stabs it. Natasha is using her Widow’s Bite on a warrior as she sits on his neck. Natasha picks up a Chitauri weapon and is using it to fight off the warriors. One warrior tries to slice her head off and she slides, dodging it. She jumps to her feet and hits it in the head with the sharp part of the weapon. Barton knocks over another warrior. He grabs an arrow and shoots behind himself, killing another warrior. He marches over to another Chitauri and battles him. Meanwhile Natasha is taking on three warriors by herself. She shoots one, then spins around and stabs one in the neck. Barton is tackled to the cement by a warrior. He groans and stabs one with a arrow, then throws the warrior to the ground. Out of nowhere, another Chitauri attacks him and kicks him onto the trunk of a cab. Natasha stabs a warrior with the Chitauri weapon. She hits the other over the head. She spins to her knees, aims in one direction, and fires. Another Chitauri charges, she spins the weapon in that direction and fires. She continuously fires as Barton fights more aliens in the background. Barton’s head is slammed into the roof of a car. He is then thrown to the ground by a warrior. He’s tired, but he continues to fight. Natasha takes on two more Chitauri. They back her onto a taxi cab. They hit after her but she moves her head out of the way. She gets her footing, and tries to hit them with the weapon but a warrior grabs it and throws her feet into the air. She lands on the car and screams in pain, breathing heavily. Barton shoots more warriors around them, they are becoming overwhelmed but they keep on. Natasha regains her strength, runs to the aid of Barton by firing at Chitauri as he slides and shoots at Chitauri. Natasha and Barton are becoming surrounded by Chitauri and Cap rejoins them -- hitting Chitauri out the way. Thor drops down from the tower and kills Chitauri with a bolt of lightening.   \n",

Elsewhere, a Leviathan approaches an office building and the inhabitants look on, scared. We hear fast & heavy footsteps. It’s Hulk charging through the building, jumping through the window and pulling the creature away. from the building. Natasha is going to town as she fights a warrior. She is thrown upon of a car. As the warrior is about to attack, Natasha uses her Widow’s Bite on it, shocking him out. She grabs the Chitauri gun and shoots him back.

Natasha runs at Rogers, who uses his shield to boost her up. She grabs on to a passing Chitauri vehicle. Cap looks up as she flies off in the distance. He looks to his right and there are more warriors coming. Natasha climbs aboard the craft, pulls a dagger and stabs a warrior. She spin kicks him off the craft.

Barton aims and fires. Loki catches the arrow inches from his face and looks first at it, then at Barton, smirking. The arrow explodes, sending Loki crashing onto the platform at the top of Stark Tower. Natasha jumps off the craft. She flips in the air, landing onto... ...the roof. She rolls, sticking the landing. She flips her hair back. Loki looks up at Romanoff when Hulk leaps up, grabbing him and throwing him through the window of the penthouse. He roars and moves towards Loki, who gets to his feet.   \n",

BACK TO SCENE: Iron Man’s knee plates open, pushing out blades. He is heading directly toward the creature’s mouth. He flies through it. Blowing up the creature’s insides and out the tail end. He crashes to the ground but gets to his feet, only to be shot down again by warriors. Barton is attacked by warriors on the rook. He reaches for an arrow, but his quiver is empty. He instead uses the bow to fight them off. Looking up at the sky and seeing hundreds of approaching flying crafts, he pulls a single arrow from the body of a Chitauri and changes its head with the push of a button on his bow. In slo-mo, The Chitauri fire and Barton leaps off the building as it explodes, twisting in mid-air, then firing the arrow. Its head opens up into a grappling hook which attaches to the side of the building. Barton swings from the wire still attached to his bow and crashes through a window into a lower floor of the building. Hulk being attacked by Chitauri warriors. He throws them off and turns his attention to the sky, where dozens of crafts are flying over him, and roars. They all fire at once and Hulk is encompassed in smoke and flame. He roars. A jet is being lifted from the hangar and to the deck.   \n",

Thor prepares to fly at Stark and catch him when the Hulk grabs him out of the air, slides down the side of a building and crashes to the ground in front of Thor and Cap. Hulk throws Iron Man off him and Thor and Cap run over. Thor pulls off Iron Man’s face plate and Cap listens for a heartbeat, then sees the arc reactor is not glowing. Suddenly the Hulk roars and beats his chest. Tony, shocked, gasps and opens his eyes, looking around.   \n",
